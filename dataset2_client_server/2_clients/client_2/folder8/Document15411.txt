ADVERTISEMENT.

At the time I published the Narrative of the Mutiny on Board the Bounty
it was my intention that the preceding part of the Voyage should be
contained in a separate account. This method I have since been induced to
alter. The reason of the Narrative appearing first was for the purpose of
communicating early information concerning an event which had attracted
the public notice: and, being drawn up in a hasty manner, it required
many corrections. Some circumstances likewise were omitted; and the
notation of time used in the Narrative being according to sea reckoning,
in which the days begin and end at noon, must have produced a degree of
obscurity and confusion to readers accustomed only to the civil mode. And
this would have increased as the remainder of the voyage, on account of
the numerous shore occurrences at Otaheite and elsewhere, could not, with
clearness and propriety, have been related in any other than the usual
manner of reckoning.

Besides remedying these inconveniencies I have thought a fuller account
of our passage from Timor to Europe than that contained in the Narrative
would not be unacceptable. These reasons, with the manifest convenience
of comprising the whole Voyage in one continued narrative, in preference
to letting it appear in disjointed accounts will, it is hoped, be allowed
a sufficient excuse for having varied from the original intention.
Nevertheless for the accommodation of the purchasers of the Narrative
already published those who desire it will be supplied with the other
parts of the Voyage separate; i.e. the part previous to the mutiny and
the additional account after leaving Timor.

A VOYAGE TO THE SOUTH SEAS, ETC.

Plan of the Expedition.
Outfit and Occurrences to the time of leaving England.
Description of the Breadfruit.

1787.

The King having been graciously pleased to comply with a request from the
merchants and planters interested in his Majesty's West India possessions
that the breadfruit tree might be introduced into those islands, a vessel
proper for the undertaking was bought and taken into dock at Deptford to
be provided with the necessary fixtures and preparations for executing
the object of the voyage. These were completed according to a plan of my
much honoured friend, Sir Joseph Banks, which in the event proved the
most advantageous that could have been adopted for the intended purpose.

August 16.

The ship was named the Bounty: I was appointed to command her on the 16th
of August 1787. Her burthen was nearly two hundred and fifteen tons; her
extreme length on deck ninety feet ten inches; extreme breadth
twenty-four feet three inches; and height in the hold under the beams at
the main hatchway ten feet three inches. In the cockpit were the cabins
of the surgeon, gunner, botanist, and clerk, with a steward-room and
storerooms. The between decks was divided in the following manner: the
great cabin was appropriated for the preservation of the plants and
extended as far forward as the after hatchway. It had two large
skylights, and on each side three scuttles for air, and was fitted with a
false floor cut full of holes to contain the garden-pots in which the
plants were to be brought home. The deck was covered with lead, and at
the foremost corners of the cabin were fixed pipes to carry off the water
that drained from the plants into tubs placed below to save it for future
use. I had a small cabin on one side to sleep in, adjoining to the great
cabin, and a place near the middle of the ship to eat in. The bulk-head
of this apartment was at the after-part of the main hatchway, and on each
side of it were the berths of the mates and midshipmen; between these
berths the arm-chest was placed. The cabin of the master, in which was
always kept the key of the arms, was opposite to mine. This particular
description of the interior parts of the ship is rendered necessary by
the event of the expedition.

The ship was masted according to the proportion of the navy; but on my
application the masts were shortened, as I thought them too much for her,
considering the nature of the voyage.

September 3.

On the 3rd of September the ship came out of dock; but the carpenters and
joiners remained on board much longer, as they had a great deal of work
to finish.

The next material alteration made in the fitting out was lessening the
quantity of iron and other ballast. I gave directions that only nineteen
tons of iron should be taken on board instead of the customary proportion
which was forty-five tons. The stores and provisions I judged would be
fully sufficient to answer the purpose of the remainder; for I am of
opinion that many of the misfortunes which attend ships in heavy storms
of wind are occasioned by too much dead weight in their bottoms.

The establishment of men and officers for the ship were as follows:

1 Lieutenant to command.
1 Master.
1 Boatswain.
1 Gunner.
1 Carpenter.
1 Surgeon.
2 Master's Mates.
2 Midshipmen.
2 Quartermasters.
1 Quartermaster's Mate.
1 Boatswain's Mate.
1 Gunner's Mate.
1 Carpenter's Mate.
1 Carpenter's Crew.
1 Sailmaker.
1 Armourer.
1 Corporal.
1 Clerk and Steward.
23 Able Seamen.
---
44.

Two skilful and careful men were appointed, at Sir Joseph Banks's
recommendation, to have the management of the plants intended to be
brought home: the one, David Nelson, who had been on similar employment
in Captain Cook's last voyage; the other, William Brown, as an assistant
to him. With these two our whole number amounted to forty-six.

It was proposed that our route to the Society Islands should be round
Cape Horn; and the greatest dispatch became necessary as the season was
already far advanced: but the shipwrights not being able to complete
their work by the time the ship was ready in other respects, our sailing
was unavoidably retarded.

October. Thursday 4.

However by the 4th of October the pilot came on board to take us down the
river.

Tuesday 9.

On the 9th we fell down to Long Reach where we received our gunner's
stores and guns, four four-pounders and ten swivels.

The ship was stored and victualled for eighteen months. In addition to
the customary allowance of provisions we were supplied with sourkraut,
portable soup, essence of malt, dried malt, and a proportion of barley
and wheat in lieu of oatmeal. I was likewise furnished with a quantity of
ironwork and trinkets to serve in our intercourse with the natives in the
South Seas: and from the board of Longitude I received a timekeeper, made
by Mr. Kendal.

Monday 15.

On the 15th I received orders to proceed to Spithead.

November. Sunday 4.

But the winds and weather were so unfavourable that we did not arrive
there till the 4th of November. On the 24th I received from Lord Hood,
who commanded at Spithead, my final orders. The wind, which for several
days before had been favourable, was now turned directly against us.

Wednesday 28.

On the 28th the ship's company received two months pay in advance, and on
the following morning we worked out to St. Helen's, where we were obliged
to anchor.

1787. December. Sunday 23.

We made different unsuccessful attempts to get down Channel, but contrary
winds and bad weather constantly forced us back to St. Helen's, or
Spithead, until Sunday the 23rd of December when we sailed with a fair
wind.

During our stay at Spithead, the rate of the timepiece was several times
examined by Mr. Bailey's observations at the Portsmouth observatory. On
the 19th of December, the last time of its being examined on shore, it
was 1 minute 52 seconds, 5 too fast for meantime, and then losing at the
rate of 1 second, 1 per day; and at this rate I estimate its going when
we sailed.

The object of all the former voyages to the South Seas undertaken by the
command of his present majesty, has been the advancement of science and
the increase of knowledge. This voyage may be reckoned the first the
intention of which has been to derive benefit from those distant
discoveries. For the more fully comprehending the nature and plan of the
expedition, and that the reader may be possessed of every information
necessary for entering on the following sheets, I shall here lay before
him a copy of the instructions I received from the admiralty, and
likewise a short description of the breadfruit.

BY THE COMMISSIONERS FOR EXECUTING THE OFFICE OF LORD HIGH ADMIRAL OF
GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND, ETC.

Whereas the king, upon a representation from the merchants and planters
interested in his Majesty's West India possessions that the introduction
of the breadfruit tree into the islands of those seas, to constitute an
article of food, would be of very essential benefit to the inhabitants,
hath, in order to promote the interests of so respectable a body of his
subjects (especially in an instance which promises general advantage)
thought fit that measures should be taken for the procuring some of those
trees, and conveying them to the said West India islands: And whereas the
vessel under your command hath, in consequence thereof, been stored and
victualled for that service, and fitted with proper conveniences and
necessaries for the preservation of as many of the said trees as, from
her size, can be taken on board her; and you have been directed to
receive on board her the two gardeners named in the margin, David Nelson,
and William Brown, who, from their knowledge of trees and plants, have
been hired for the purpose of selecting such as shall appear to be of a
proper species and size:

You are, therefore, in pursuance of his majesty's pleasure, signified to
us by Lord Sydney, one of his principal secretaries of state, hereby
required and directed to put to sea in the vessel you command, the first
favourable opportunity of wind and weather, and proceed with her, as
expeditiously as possible, round Cape Horn, to the Society Islands,
situate in the Southern ocean, in the latitude of about eighteen degrees
south, and longitude of about two hundred and ten degrees east from
Greenwich, where, according to the accounts given by the late Captain
Cook, and persons who accompanied him during his voyages, the breadfruit
tree is to be found in the most luxuriant state.

Having arrived at the above-mentioned islands, and taken on board as many
trees and plants as may be thought necessary (the better to enable you to
do which, you have already been furnished with such articles of
merchandise and trinkets as it is supposed will be wanted to satisfy the
natives) you are to proceed from thence through Endeavour Straits (which
separate New Holland from New Guinea) to Prince's Island in the Straits
of Sunda, or, if it should happen to be more convenient, to pass on the
eastern side of Java to some port on the north side of that island, where
any breadfruit trees which may have been injured, or have died, may be
replaced by mangosteens, duriens, jacks, nancas, lanfas, and other fine
fruit trees of that quarter, as well as the rice plant which grows upon
dry land; all of which species (or such of them as shall be judged most
eligible) you are to purchase on the best terms you can from the
inhabitants of that island with the ducats with which you have also been
furnished for that purpose; taking care however, if the rice plants
above-mentioned cannot be procured at Java, to touch at Prince's Island
for them, where they are regularly cultivated.

From Prince's Island, or the Island of Java, you are to proceed round the
Cape of Good Hope to the West Indies (calling on your way thither at any
places which may be thought necessary) and deposit one half of such of
the above-mentioned trees and plants as may be then alive at his
majesty's botanical garden at St. Vincent, for the benefit of the
Windward Islands, and then go on to Jamaica: and, having delivered the
remainder to Mr. East, or such person or persons as may be authorised by
the governor and council of that island to receive them, refreshed your
people, and received on board such provisions and stores as may be
necessary for the voyage, make the best of your way back to England;
repairing to Spithead, and sending to our secretary an account of your
arrival and proceedings.

And whereas you will receive herewith a copy of the instructions which
have been given to the above-mentioned gardeners for their guidance, as
well as in procuring the said trees and plants, and the management of
them after they shall be put on board, as for bringing to England a small
sample of each species, and such others as may be prepared by the
superintendent of the botanical garden at St. Vincent's, and by the said
Mr. East, or others, for his majesty's garden at Kew; you are hereby
required and directed to afford, and to give directions to your officers
and company to afford, the said gardeners every possible aid and
assistance, not only in the collecting of the said trees and plants at
the places before mentioned, but for their preservation during their
conveyance to the places of their destination.

Given under our hands the 20th November 1787.

...

In the foregoing orders it is to be observed that I was particularly
directed to proceed round Cape Horn but, as the season was so far
advanced and we were so long detained by contrary winds, I made
application to the Admiralty for discretional orders on that point; to
which I received the following answer:

BY THE COMMISSIONERS FOR EXECUTING THE OFFICE OF LORD HIGH ADMIRAL OF
GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND, ETC. ETC.

The season of the year being now so far advanced as to render it probable
that your arrival with the vessel you command on the southern coast of
America will be too late for your passing round Cape Horn without much
difficulty and hazard, you are in that case at liberty (notwithstanding
former orders) to proceed in her to Otaheite, round the Cape of Good
Hope.

The Breadfruit is so well known and described that to attempt a new
account of it would be unnecessary and useless. However as it may
contribute to the convenience of the reader I have given the following
extracts respecting it with the plate annexed.

EXTRACT FROM THE ACCOUNT OF DAMPIER'S VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD PERFORMED IN
1688.

The breadfruit (as we call it) grows on a large tree, as big and high as
our largest apple-trees: It hath a spreading head, full of branches and
dark leaves. The fruit grows on the boughs like apples; it is as big as a
penny-loaf when wheat is at five shillings the bushel; it is of a round
shape, and hath a thick tough rind. When the fruit is ripe it is yellow
and soft, and the taste is sweet and pleasant. The natives of Guam use it
for bread. They gather it, when full-grown, while it is green and hard;
then they bake it in an oven, which scorches the rind and makes it black;
but they scrape off the outside black crust, and there remains a tender
thin crust; and the inside is soft, tender, and white like the crumb of a
penny-loaf. There is NEITHER SEED NOR STONE in the inside, but all is of
a pure substance, like bread. It must be eaten new; for, if it is kept
above twenty-four hours, it grows harsh and choaky; but it is very
pleasant before it is too stale. This fruit lasts in season EIGHT MONTHS
in the year, during which the natives eat NO OTHER SORT OF FOOD OF BREAD
KIND. I did never see of this fruit anywhere but here. The natives told
us that there is plenty of this fruit growing on the rest of the Ladrone
islands; and I DID NEVER HEAR OF IT ANYWHERE ELSE. Volume 1 page 296.

...

EXTRACT FROM THE ACCOUNT OF LORD ANSON'S VOYAGE, PUBLISHED BY MR. WALTER.

There was at Tinian a kind of fruit, peculiar to these (Ladrone) islands,
called by the Indians rhymay, but by us the breadfruit; for it was
constantly eaten by us, during our stay upon the island, * instead of
bread; and so UNIVERSALLY PREFERRED that no ship's bread was expended in
that whole interval. It grew upon a tree which is somewhat lofty, and
which towards the top divides into large and spreading branches. The
leaves of this tree are of a remarkable deep green, are notched about the
edges, and are generally from a foot to eighteen inches in length. The
fruit itself is found indifferently on all parts of the branches; it is
in shape rather elliptical than round; it is covered with a tough rind
and is usually seven or eight inches long; each of them grows singly and
not in clusters. This fruit is fittest to be used when it is full-grown
but still green; in which state, after it is properly prepared by being
roasted in the embers, its taste has some distant resemblance to that of
an artichoke's bottom, and its texture is not very different, for it is
soft and spongy.

(*Footnote. About two months, namely from the latter end of August to the
latter end of October, 1742.)

...

EXTRACTS FROM THE ACCOUNT OF THE FIRST VOYAGE OF CAPTAIN COOK.
HAWKESWORTH, VOLUME 2.

IN THE SOCIETY ISLANDS.

The breadfruit grows on a tree that is about the size of a middling oak;
its leaves are frequently a foot and a half long, of an oblong shape,
deeply sinuated like those of the fig-tree, which they resemble in
consistence and colour, and in the exuding of a white milky juice upon
being broken. The fruit is about the size and shape of a child's head,
and the surface is reticulated not much unlike a truffle: it is covered
with a thin skin, and has a core about as big as the handle of a small
knife. The eatable part lies between the skin and the core; it is as
white as snow, and somewhat of the consistence of new bread: it must be
roasted before it is eaten, being first divided into three or four parts.
Its taste is insipid, with a slight sweetness somewhat resembling that of
the crumb of wheaten bread mixed with a Jerusalem artichoke.

Pages 80, 81. See also the plate there and at page 232.

Of the many vegetables that have been mentioned already as serving them
for food, the principal is the breadfruit, to procure which costs them no
trouble or labour but climbing a tree. The tree which produces it does
not indeed shoot up spontaneously, but if a man plants ten of them in his
lifetime, which he may do in about an hour, he will as completely fulfil
his duty to his own and future generations as the native of our less
temperate climate can do by ploughing in the cold winter, and reaping in
the summer's heat, as often as these seasons return; even if, after he
has procured bread for his present household, he should convert a surplus
into money, and lay it up for his children.

It is true indeed that the breadfruit is not always in season; but
coconuts, bananas, plantains, and a great variety of other fruits supply
the deficiency. Page 197.

EXTRACT FROM THE ACCOUNT OF CAPTAIN COOK'S LAST VOYAGE.

IN THE SOCIETY ISLANDS.

I (Captain Cook) have inquired very carefully into their manner of
cultivating the breadfruit tree at Otaheite; but was always answered that
they never planted it. This indeed must be evident to everyone who will
examine the places where the young trees come up. It will be always
observed that they spring from the roots of the old ones which run along
near the surface of the ground. So that the breadfruit trees may be
reckoned those that would naturally cover the plains, even supposing that
the island was not inhabited, in the same manner that the white-barked
trees, found at Van Diemen's Land, constitute the forests there. And from
this we may observe that the inhabitant of Otaheite, instead of being
obliged to plant his bread, will RATHER be under the necessity of
preventing its progress; which I suppose is sometimes done to give room
for trees of another sort, to afford him some variety in his food. Volume
2 page 145.

IN THE SANDWICH ISLANDS.

The breadfruit trees are planted, and flourish with great luxuriance, on
rising grounds. Where the hills rise almost perpendicularly in a great
variety of peaked forms, their steep sides and the deep chasms between
them are covered with trees, amongst which those of the breadfruit were
observed particularly to abound. Volume 3 pages 105 and 114, containing
Captain King's Narrative.

The climate of the Sandwich Islands differs very little from that of the
West India Islands, which lie IN THE SAME LATITUDE. Upon the whole
perhaps it may be rather more temperate. Captain King ib page 116.

The breadfruit trees thrive in these islands, not in such abundance, but
produce double the quantity of fruit they do on the rich plains of
Otaheite. The trees are nearly of the same height, but the branches begin
to strike out from the trunk much lower, and with greater luxuriance.
Captain King ib page 120.


CHAPTER 2.

Departure from England.
Arrival at Tenerife.
Sail from thence.
Arrival off Cape Horn.
Severity of the Weather.
Obliged to bear away for the Cape of Good Hope.

1787. December. Sunday 23.

On Sunday morning the 23rd of December 1787 we sailed from Spithead and,
passing through the Needles, directed our course down channel with a
fresh gale of wind at east. In the afternoon one of the seamen, in
furling the main-top-gallant-sail, fell off the yard and was so fortunate
as to save himself by catching hold of the main-top-mast-stay in his
fall. At night the wind increased to a strong gale with a heavy sea.

Tuesday 25.

It moderated however on the 25th and allowed us to keep our Christmas
with cheerfulness; but the following day it blew a severe storm of wind
from the eastward, which continued till the 29th, in the course of which
we suffered greatly. One sea broke away the spare yards and spars out of
the starboard main chains. Another heavy sea broke into the ship and
stove all the boats. Several casks of beer that had been lashed upon deck
were broke loose and washed overboard, and it was not without great
difficulty and risk that we were able to secure the boats from being
washed away entirely.

Saturday 29.

On the 29th we were in latitude 39 degrees 35 minutes north and longitude
14 degrees 26 minutes west when the gale abated and the weather became
fair. Besides other mischief done to us by the storm, a large quantity of
our bread was damaged and rendered useless, for the sea had stove in our
stern and filled the cabin with water. From this time to our arrival at
Tenerife we had moderate weather and winds mostly from the northward.

1788. January.

January 4.

This forenoon we spoke a French ship bound to the Mauritius.

Saturday 5. Tenerife.

The next day at nine in the forenoon we saw the island of Tenerife
bearing west-south-west half west about twelve leagues distant. It was
covered with a thick haze except the north-westernmost part which is a
remarkable headland, resembling a horse's head, the ears very distinct.
To the eastward of this head* lie two round rocks, the northern boundary
of Tenerife. I had a good observation at noon by which I make the
latitude of the two rocks 28 degrees 44 minutes north and their longitude
by our timekeeper 16 degrees 5 minutes west. To the southward of these
and near the shore is a high needle rock: about four leagues farther to
the southward the coast inclines towards the west to the road of Santa
Cruz, where we anchored at half-past nine on Sunday morning in
twenty-five fathoms water, and moored along shore in the same depth, with
the cupola tower of the church of St. Francis bearing west half north one
mile, the east part of the road east by north, the castle on the south
point south-west, and the west part of the Grand Canary south-south-east.
A Spanish packet bound to Corunna, an American brig, and several other
vessels, were lying here.

(*Footnote. South 82 degrees east by the compass.)

As soon as the ship was anchored I sent an officer (Mr. Christian) to
wait on the governor and to acquaint him I had put in to obtain
refreshments and to repair the damages we had sustained in bad weather.
To this I had a very polite answer from the governor, * that I should be
supplied with whatever the island afforded. I had also directed the
officer to acquaint him that I would salute, provided an equal number of
guns were to be returned but, as I received an extraordinary answer to
this part of my message, purporting that his excellency did not return
the same number but to persons equal in rank to himself, this ceremony
was omitted.

(*Footnote. Marquis de Brancheforte.)

During this interval I was visited by the port-master (Captain Adams) and
shortly afterwards several officers came on board from his excellency to
compliment me on my arrival. As soon as the ship was moored I went on
shore and paid my respects to him.

Monday 7.

On Monday morning I began to forward the ship's business with the utmost
dispatch, and gave the necessary directions to Messrs. Collogan and sons,
the contractors, for the supplies I wanted. I also got leave of the
governor for Mr. Nelson to range the hills and examine the country in
search of plants and natural curiosities.

As there was a great surf on the shore I bargained for everything I
wanted to be brought off by the shore boats, and agreed to give five
shillings per ton for water. Very good wine was bought at ten pounds per
pipe, the contract price; but the superior quality was fifteen pounds;
and some of this was not much inferior to the best London Madeira. I
found this was an unfavourable season for other refreshments: Indian
corn, potatoes, pumpkins, and onions, were all very scarce and double the
price of what they are in summer. Beef also was difficult to be procured
and exceedingly poor; the price nearly sixpence farthing per pound. The
corn was three current dollars per fanega, which is full five shillings
per bushel; and biscuit at twenty-five shillings for the hundred pounds.
Poultry was so scarce that a good fowl cost three shillings. This is
therefore not a place for ships to expect refreshments at a reasonable
price at this time of the year, wine excepted; but from March to November
supplies are plentiful, particularly fruit, of which at this time we
could procure none except a few dried figs and some bad oranges.

NAUTICAL REMARKS.

During our stay here the weather was fair with north-east winds and calms
and small drizzling rain in the night. The thermometer from 66 to 69
degrees at noon in the shade. I could make no lunar observations for the
longitude, but by the help of the timekeeper I have computed the
situation of the town of Santa Cruz to be 28 degrees 28 minutes north
latitude and 16 degrees 18 minutes west longitude. I observed the
variation by two compasses to be 20 degrees 1 minute west: this much
exceeded what I could have imagined; for in 1776 I observed it only 14
degrees 40 minutes west; a difference of above five degrees in eleven
years: and this makes me reflect on the uncertainty of obtaining the
exact deviation of the magnetic pole, and of course its annual variation
which never can be accurately ascertained unless the observations are
made always in one spot and with the same compass.

Tenerife, though considerably without the tropic, is so nearly within the
limits of the tradewind that navigators generally steer to it from the
eastward. The road of Santa Cruz lies on the east side of the island, at
the end of a range of craggy hills, barren and very lofty, along with you
sail west by south by compass into the road, with a sea unfathomable
until near the shore. The anchoring ground may be accounted from fifty
fathoms to twenty, or even fifteen. The bank is very steep and gives but
little time to sound; for which reason it should be done effectually with
a heavy lead, or a ship will be too near in before a stranger is aware of
it: he will likewise too soon expect to find bottom, owing to the great
deception of the adjacent high land. To obviate these difficulties it is
necessary to observe that while a town which lies some distance to the
southward of Santa Cruz is open with the castle on the south part of the
road, though you may appear near to the shore, there is no anchorage; but
after it is shut entirely in you get on the bank. The church bearing west
or west by south and the south point of the road south-west half south to
south-west by west is a good situation for anchoring: the depth about
twenty-five fathoms. The distance from the shore will be three quarters
of a mile; and the southernmost land that can be seen then will be a half
or quarter point of the compass farther out than the south point of the
road.

The bottom is black soft mud, with some patches of rocks; for which
reason vessels that lie here any length of time buoy their cables. This
precaution, besides being useful in that particular, they think makes
them ride more easy when there is much sea setting into the road, which,
with the wind any way to the southward of east or at south-west, must be
very considerable; it is therefore usual to moor with four anchors,
though more than two are scarce ever of use. Mooring is however advisable
if a ship is only to remain twenty-four hours, and the tighter the
better, that the cables may keep clear of the ground.

The landing on the beach is generally impracticable with our own boats,
at least without great risk; but there is a very fine pier on which
people may land without difficulty if there is not much swell in the
road. To this pier the water is conveyed by pipes for the use of
shipping, and for which all merchant-ships pay.

There is a degree of wretchedness and want among the lower class of
people which is not anywhere so common as among the Spanish and
Portuguese settlements. To alleviate these evils the present governor of
Tenerife has instituted a most charitable society which he takes the
trouble to superintend; and by considerable contributions a large airy
dwelling that contains one hundred and twenty poor girls and as many men
and boys has been built and endowed with a sufficiency of land round it,
not only for all present purposes but for enlarging the building for more
objects of charity as their funds increase. I had the honour to be shown
by his excellency this asylum (Hospicio they call it) where there
appeared in every countenance the utmost cheerfulness and content. The
decency and neatness of the dress of the young females, with the order in
which they were arranged at their spinning-wheels and looms in an
extensive airy apartment, was admirable. A governess inspected and
regulated all their works, which were the manufacturing of ribbons of all
colours, coarse linens, and tapes; all which were managed and brought to
perfection by themselves from the silk and flax in their first state;
even the dying of the colours is performed by them. These girls are
received for five years, at the end of which they are at liberty to
marry, and have for their portions their wheel and loom, with a sum of
money proportioned to the state of the fund, which is assisted by the
produce of their labour, and at this time was estimated at two thousand
dollars per annum.

The men and boys are not less attended to: they are employed in coarser
work, blanketing and all kinds of common woollens: if they become infirm
they spend the remainder of their days here comfortably and under a
watchful inspector who attends them in the same manner as the governess
does the girls. They are all visited every day by the governor, and a
clergyman attends them every evening. By this humane institution a number
of people are rendered useful and industrious in a country where the
poor, from the indulgence of the climate, are too apt to prefer a life of
inactivity, though attended with wretchedness, to obtaining the comforts
of life by industry and labour.

The number of inhabitants in the island I was informed were estimated at
between eighty and one hundred thousand. Their annual export of wine is
twenty thousand pipes and of brandy half that quantity. Vessels are
frequently here from St. Eustatia, and from thence a great quantity of
Tenerife wine is carried to the different parts of the West Indies, under
the name of Madeira.

Tenerife is considered of more value than all the other Canaries: the
inhabitants however, in scarce seasons, receive supplies from the Grand
Canary; but their vineyards here are said to be greatly superior. Their
produce of corn, though exceedingly good, is not sufficient for their
consumption; and owing to this the Americans have an advantageous trade
here for their flour and grain, and take wine in return.

The town of Santa Cruz is about half a mile in extent each way, built in
a regular manner, and the houses in general large and airy, but the
streets are very ill paved. I am told that they are subject to few
diseases; but if any epidemic distemper breaks out it is attended with
the most fatal consequences, particularly the smallpox, the bad effects
of which they now endeavour to counteract by inoculation. For this reason
they are very circumspect in admitting ships to have communication with
the shore without bills of health.

A sloop from London, called the Chance, William Meridith, master, bound
to Barbados, out nineteen days from the Downs, came into the road the day
before we sailed. She had suffered much by the bad weather but, having
brought no bill of health, the governor would not allow any person to
come on shore unless I could vouch for them that no epidemic disease
raged in England at the time they sailed, which I was able to do, it
being nearly at the same time that I left the land; and by that means
they had the governor's permission to receive the supplies they wanted
without being obliged to perform quarantine.

Thursday 10.

Having finished our business at Tenerife on Thursday the 10th we sailed
with the wind at south-east, our ship's company all in good health and
spirits.

I now divided the people into three watches, and gave the charge of the
third watch to Mr. Fletcher Christian, one of the mates. I have always
considered this as a desirable regulation when circumstances will admit
of it on many accounts; and am persuaded that unbroken rest not only
contributes much towards the health of a ship's company but enables them
more readily to exert themselves in cases of sudden emergency.

As it was my wish to proceed to Otaheite without stopping I ordered
everybody to be at two-thirds allowance of bread: I also directed the
water for drinking to be filtered though dripstones that I had bought at
Tenerife for that purpose.

In the evening we passed the south end of Tenerife which is a round lump
of land that, from the lowness of the contiguous land, has at a distance
the appearance of a separate island. By our run from the bay of Santa
Cruz I make the latitude of the south end of Tenerife to be 28 degrees 6
minutes north.

We ran all night towards the south-south-west having the wind at
south-east. The next morning we could see nothing of the land. I now made
the ship's company acquainted with the intent of the voyage and, having
been permitted to hold out this encouragement to them, I gave assurances
of the certainty of promotion to everyone whose endeavours should merit
it.

The winds for some days after leaving Tenerife were mostly from the
southward. Fishing-lines and tackle were distributed amongst the people
and some dolphins were caught.

Thursday 17.

On the 17th the wind came round to the north-east and continued steady in
that quarter till the 25th on which day at noon we were in 3 degrees 54
minutes north. As the cloudiness of the sky gave us reason to expect much
rain we prepared the awnings with hoses for the convenience of saving
water, in which we were not disappointed. From this time to our meeting
with the south-east tradewind we had much wet weather, the air close and
sultry with calms, and light variable winds generally from the southward.

Tuesday 29.

On the 29th there was so heavy a fall of rain that we caught seven
hundred gallons of water.

Thursday 31.

On the 31st, latitude at noon 2 degrees 5 minutes north, found a current
setting to the north-east at the rate of fourteen miles in the
twenty-four hours. The thermometer was at 82 degrees in the shade, and 81
1/2 degrees at the surface of the sea, so that the air and the water were
within half a degree of the same temperature. At eight o'clock in the
evening we observed a violent rippling in the sea about half a mile to
the north-west of us which had very much the appearance of breakers. This
I imagine to have been occasioned by a large school (or multitude) of
fish as it was exactly in the track the ship had passed, so that if any
real shoal had been there we must have seen it at the close of the
evening when a careful lookout was always kept. However if it had
appeared ahead of us instead of astern I should certainly have tacked to
avoid it. To such appearances I attribute the accounts of many shoals
within the tropics which cannot be found anywhere but in maps. Our
latitude at this time was 2 degrees 8 minutes north and longitude 19
degrees 43 minutes west. The next day we had more of these appearances
from the number of schools of fish by which the ship was surrounded.

February. Saturday 2.

This morning we saw a sail to the north-north-west but at too great a
distance to distinguish what she was.

Monday 4.

Had very heavy rain during which we nearly filled all our empty water
casks. So much wet weather, with the closeness of the air, covered
everything with mildew. The ship was aired below with fires and
frequently sprinkled with vinegar; and every little interval of dry
weather was taken advantage of to open all the hatchways, and clean the
ship, and to have all the people's wet things washed and dried.

With this weather and light unsteady winds we advanced but 2 1/2 degrees
in twelve days; at the end of which time we were relieved by the
south-east tradewind which we fell in with on the 6th at noon in latitude
1 degree 21 minutes north and longitude 20 degrees 42 minutes west.

Thursday 7.

The next afternoon we crossed the equinoctial line in longitude 21
degrees 50 minutes west. The weather became fine and the south-east
tradewind was fresh and steady, with which we kept a point free from the
wind and got to the southward at a good rate.

The weather continuing dry we put some of our bread in casks, properly
prepared for its reception, to preserve it from vermin: this experiment
we afterwards found answered exceedingly well.

Saturday 16.

On the 16th at daylight we saw a sail to the southward. The next day we
came up with her and found her to be the British Queen, Simon Paul,
master, from London, bound to the Cape of Good Hope on the whale-fishery.
She sailed from Falmouth the 5th of December, eighteen days before I left
Spithead. By this ship I wrote to England. At sunset she was almost out
of sight astern.

Monday 18.

In the course of this day's run the variation changed from west to east.
According to our observations the true and magnetic meridians coincided
in latitude 20 degrees 0 minutes south and longitude 31 degrees 15
minutes west. At noon we were in latitude 20 degrees 44 minutes south and
longitude 31 degrees 23 minutes west. In our advances towards the south
the wind had gradually veered round to the east and was at this time at
east-north-east. The weather after crossing the Line had been fine and
clear, but the air so sultry as to occasion great faintness, the
quicksilver in the thermometer in the daytime standing at between 81 and
83 degrees, and one time at 85 degrees. In our passage through the
northern tropic the air was temperate, the sun having then high south
declination and the weather being generally fine till we lost the
north-east tradewind; but such a thick haze surrounded the horizon that
no object could be seen except at a very small distance. The haze
commonly cleared away at sunset and gathered again at sunrise. Between
the north-east and south-east tradewinds the calms and rains, if of long
continuance, are very liable to produce sickness unless great attention
is paid to keeping the ship clean and wholesome by giving all the air
possible, drying between decks with fires, and drying and airing the
people's clothes and bedding. Besides these precautions we frequently
wetted with vinegar, and every evening the pumps were used as
ventilators. With these endeavours to secure health we passed the low
latitudes without a single complaint.

The currents we met with were by no means regular, nor have I ever found
them so in the middle of the ocean. However from the channel to the
southward as far as Madeira there is generally a current setting to the
south-south-east.

Thursday 21.

On the evening of the 21st a ship was seen in the north-east but at too
great a distance to distinguish of what country.

Friday 22.

The next day the wind came round to the north and north-west so that we
could no longer consider ourselves in the tradewind. Our latitude at noon
was 25 degrees 55 minutes south, longitude 36 degrees 29 minutes west.
Variation of the compass three degrees east.

Saturday 23.

Towards night the wind died away and we had some heavy showers of rain of
which we profited by saving a ton of good water. The next day we caught a
shark and five dolphins.

Tuesday 26.

We bent new sails and made other necessary preparations for encountering
the weather that was to be expected in a high latitude. Our latitude at
noon was 29 degrees 38 minutes south, longitude 41 degrees 44 minutes
west. Variation 7 degrees 13 minutes east. In the afternoon, the wind
being westerly and blowing strong in squalls, some butterflies and other
insects like what we call horseflies were blown on board of us. No birds
were seen except shearwaters. Our distance from the coast of Brazil at
this time was above 100 leagues.

March. Sunday 2.

In the forenoon, after seeing that every person was clean, divine service
was performed according to my usual custom on this day. I gave to Mr.
Fletcher Christian, whom I had before directed to take charge of the
third watch, a written order to act as lieutenant.

Saturday 8.

We were at noon in latitude 36 degrees 50 minutes south and longitude 52
degrees 53 minutes west. The last four days we several times tried for
soundings without finding bottom, though considerably to the westward of
Captain Wallis' track, who had soundings at fifty-four fathoms depth in
latitude 35 degrees 40 minutes south and longitude 49 degrees 54 minutes
west. This day we tried with two hundred and forty fathoms of line but
did not find bottom; at the same time, observing a rippling in the water,
we tried the current by mooring a keg with one hundred fathoms of line,
by which it appeared to run to the north-north-west at the rate of a mile
and a half per hour. By the noon observation however we were eighteen
miles to the southward of our reckoning. In the afternoon we saw a turtle
floating and, not having much wind, hoisted a boat out and sent after it;
but it was found to be in a putrid state with a number of crabs feeding
upon it.

The change of temperature began now to be sensibly felt, there being a
variation in the thermometer since yesterday of eight degrees. That the
people might not suffer by their own negligence I gave orders for their
light tropical clothing to be put by, and made them dress in a manner
more suited to a cold climate. I had provided for this before I left
England by giving directions for such clothes to be purchased as were
necessary.

Monday 10.

In the forenoon we struck soundings at eighty-three fathoms depth; our
latitude 40 degrees 8 minutes south and longitude 55 degrees 40 minutes
west. This I conclude to have been near the edge of the bank for, the
wind being at south-south-west, we stood towards the south-east; and
after running fourteen miles in that direction we could find no bottom
with one hundred and sixty fathoms of line. In the night we stood towards
the west-south-west with a southerly wind and got again into soundings.
The next day we saw a great number of whales of an immense size that had
two spout-holes on the back of the head. Upon a complaint made to me by
the master I found it necessary to punish Matthew Quintal, one of the
seamen, with two dozen lashes for insolence and mutinous behaviour.
Before this I had not had occasion to punish any person on board.

Wednesday 12.

On the 12th we caught a porpoise by striking it with the grains. Everyone
eat heartily of it; and it was so well liked that no part was wasted.

Friday 14.

On the 14th in the afternoon we saw a land-bird like a lark, and passed
part of a dead whale that had been left by some whalers after they had
taken the blubber off. Saw likewise two strange sail. The next day at
noon our latitude was 43 degrees 6 minutes south and longitude 58 degrees
42 minutes west. Had soundings at seventy-five fathoms; the bottom a fine
greenish sand. Saw two hawks.

Sunday 16.

On the 16th another ship was seen to the west-north-west standing to the
northward. Latitude at noon 43 degrees 34 minutes south. We continued
running to the southward keeping in soundings.

Wednesday 19.

On the 19th at noon by my account we were within twenty leagues of Port
Desire; but the wind blowing fresh from the north-west with thick foggy
weather I did not attempt to make the land. We passed a good deal of
rock-weed and saw many whales, and albatrosses and other seabirds.

Thursday 20.

On the 20th at noon our latitude was 50 degrees 24 minutes south and
longitude 65 degrees 50 minutes west. In the afternoon the wind, which
had for some time past been northerly, suddenly shifted to the
west-south-west and blew hard.

Sunday 23.

We steered to the south-south-east and on the 23rd at two o'clock in the
morning we discovered the coast of Tierra del Fuego bearing south-east.
At nine in the forenoon we were off Cape St. Diego, the eastern part of
Tierra del Fuego. Observed the variation here to be 21 degrees 23 east.
The wind being unfavourable I thought it more advisable to go round to
the eastward of Staten Land than to attempt passing through Straits le
Maire. The two opposite coasts of the Straits exhibited very different
appearances. The land of Tierra del Fuego hereabouts, though the interior
parts are mountainous, yet near the coast is of a moderate height and, at
the distance we were from it, had not an unpromising appearance. The
coast of Staten Land near the Straits is mountainous and craggy, and
remarkable for its high peaked hills. Straits le Maire is a fair opening
which cannot well be mistaken; but if any doubt could remain, the
different appearances of the opposite shores would sufficiently make the
Straits known.

I did not sail within less than six leagues of the coast that we might
have the wind more regular and avoid being exposed to the heavy squalls
that came off from the land. At noon Cape St. Anthony bore south and the
westernmost of New Year's Isles south-east one-quarter south, five or six
leagues. Latitude observed 54 degrees 28 minutes south, longitude 64
degrees 4 minutes west.

The sight of New Year's Harbour almost tempted me to put in; but the
lateness of the season and the people being in good health determined me
to lay aside all thoughts of refreshment until we should reach Otaheite.
At two o'clock in the afternoon the easternmost of New Year's Isles,
where Captain Cook observed the latitude to be 55 degrees 40 minutes
south, bore from us south four leagues. We saw the entrance isles of New
Year's harbour at the back of which the land is very craggy and
mountainous. This must be a very convenient port to touch at as the
access to it is safe and easy. The harbour lies south-south-east by
compass from the north-east part of the easternmost of the New Year's
Islands.

About two leagues to the westward of Cape St. John I observed the
separation of the mountains that Captain Cook has taken notice of, which
has the appearance of Staten Land being there divided into two islands.

At sunset Cape St. John bore south-south-east five or six leagues. The
land hereabouts is of less height and not so rugged as near New Year's
Harbour. The night coming on I could get no good view of the coast near
the Cape; and at daylight next morning we were at too great a distance.

Monday 24.

We had stood to the southward all night with the wind at west-south-west
and south-west. At eight in the morning Cape St. John bore north-west ten
leagues distant. Soon after we lost sight of the land.

From the result of my lunar observations, assisted by the timekeeper, I
make the longitude of the west side of Straits le Maire 64 degrees 48
minutes west; the easternmost of the New Year's isles 63 degrees 52
minutes west; and the longitude of Cape St. John 63 degrees 19 minutes
west.

In our run from the latitude of 12 degrees south to 48 degrees south the
ship was set 2 degrees 30 minutes to the eastward by currents; and from
the latitude of 48 degrees south to Staten Land the currents set us to
the westward 2 degrees 43 minutes; which I imagine to have been
occasioned by an indraught into the Straits of Magellan.

From the time we lost sight of the land to the end of the month we were
struggling with bad weather and contrary winds.

Monday 31.

But on the morning of the 31st the wind came to the north-north-east and
made us entertain great hopes that we should be able to accomplish our
passage round the Cape without much difficulty. At noon we were in
latitude 60 degrees 1 minute south and in 71 degrees 45 minutes west
longitude, which is 8 degrees 26 minutes west of the meridian of Cape St.
John. This flattering appearance was not of long continuance: in the
night the wind became variable and next day settled again in the west and
north-west with very bad weather.

April. Wednesday 2.

On the 2nd in the morning the wind, which had blown fresh all night from
the north-west, came round to the south-west and increased to a heavy
gale. At six in the morning the storm exceeded what I had ever met with
before; and the sea, from the frequent shifting of the wind, running in
contrary directions, broke exceeding high. Our ship however lay to very
well under a main and fore-stay sail. The gale continued with severe
squalls of hail and sleet the remainder of this and all the next day.

Friday 4.

On the 4th the wind was less violent but far from moderate. With so much
bad weather I found it necessary to keep a constant fire night and day;
and one of the watch always attended to dry the people's wet clothes: and
this I have no doubt contributed as much to their health as to their
comfort.

Our companions in this in hospitable region were albatrosses and two
beautiful kinds of birds, the small blue petrel and pintada. A great many
of these were frequently about the wake of the ship, which induced the
people to float a line with hooks baited to endeavour to catch them and
their attempts were successful. The method they used was to fasten the
bait a foot or two before the hook and, by giving the line a sudden jerk
when the bird was at the bait, it was hooked in the feet or body.

Sunday 6.

On the 6th the weather was moderate and continued so till the 9th with
the wind veering between the north-west and south-west; of which we were
able to take advantage.

Monday 7.

On the 7th observed the variation 27 degrees 9 minutes east; our latitude
60 degrees 24 minutes south and longitude 75 degrees 54 minutes west.

Wednesday 9.

On the 9th at noon we were in latitude 59 degrees 31 minutes south and
our longitude 76 degrees 58 minutes west, which is farther to the west
than we had yet been. The weather was now unfavourable again, blowing
strong from the westward with a high sea.

On the 10th we saw some fish which appeared spotted and about the size of
bonetos: these were the only fish we had seen in this high latitude.

Saturday 12.

The stormy weather continued with a great sea. The ship now began to
complain and required to be pumped every hour; which was no more than we
had reason to expect from such a continuance of gales of wind and high
seas. The decks also became so leaky that it was obliged to allot the
great cabin, of which I made little use except in fine weather, to those
people who had wet berths to hang their hammocks in, and by this means
the between decks was less crowded.

Every morning all the hammocks were taken down from where they hung, and
when the weather was too bad to keep them upon deck they were put in the
cabin; so that the between decks were cleaned daily and aired with fires
if the hatchways could not be opened. With all this bad weather we had
the additional mortification to find at the end of every day that we were
losing ground; for notwithstanding our utmost exertions and keeping on
the most advantageous tacks (which if the weather had been at all
moderate would have sufficiently answered our purpose) yet the greater
part of the time we were doing little better than drifting before the
wind.

Sunday 13.

Birds as usual were about the ship and some of them caught; and for the
first time since we left Staten Land we saw some whales. This morning,
owing to the violent motion of the ship, the cook fell and broke one of
his ribs, and another man, by a fall, dislocated his shoulder. The gunner
who had the charge of a watch was laid up with the rheumatism: and this
was the first sicklist that appeared on board the ship. The time of full
moon which was approaching made me entertain hopes that after that period
we should experience some change of wind or weather in our favour; but
the event did not at all answer our expectations. The latitude at noon
this day was 58 degrees 9 minutes south and longitude 76 degrees 1 minute
west.

As we caught a good many birds but which were all lean and tasted fishy
we tried an experiment upon them which succeeded admirably. By keeping
them cooped up and cramming them with ground corn they improved
wonderfully in a short time; so that the pintada birds became as fine as
ducks, and the albatrosses were as fat, and not inferior in taste to,
fine geese. Some of the latter birds were caught that measured seven feet
between the extremities of the wings when spread. This unexpected supply
came very opportunely; for none of our livestock remained except hogs,
the sheep and poultry not being hardy enough to stand the severity of the
weather.

Sunday 20.

This morning the wind died away and we had a calm for a few hours which
gave us hopes that the next would be a more favourable wind. A hog was
killed for the ship's company which gave them an excellent meal. Towards
noon, to our great disappointment, the wind sprang up again from the
westward and in the afternoon blew strong with snow and hailstorms.

Monday 21.

This was the second day after the full moon but, as I have remarked
before, it had no influence on the weather. At noon our latitude was 58
degrees 31 minutes south and longitude 70 degrees 7 minutes west, which
is near seven degrees to the eastward of our situation on the morning of
the 9th instant, when we had advanced the farthest in our power to the
westward, being then in 76 degrees 58 minutes west, three degrees to the
west of Cape Deseada, the west part of the Straits of Magellan; and at
this time we were 3 degrees 52 minutes to the east of it and hourly
losing ground.

It was with much concern I saw how hopeless and even unjustifiable it was
to persist any longer in attempting a passage this way to the Society
Islands. We had been thirty days in this tempestuous ocean. At one time
we had advanced so far to the westward as to have a fair prospect of
making our passage round; but from that period hard gales of westerly
wind had continued without intermission, a few hours excepted, which, to
borrow an expression in Lord Anson's voyage, were "like the elements
drawing breath to return upon us with redoubled violence." The season was
now too far advanced for us to expect more favourable winds or weather,
and we had sufficiently experienced the impossibility of beating round
against the wind, or of advancing at all without the help of a fair wind
for which there was little reason to hope. Another consideration which
had great weight with me was that, if I persisted in my attempt this way
and should after all fail to get round, it would occasion such a loss of
time that our arrival at Otaheite soon enough to return in the proper
season by the East Indies would be rendered precarious. On the other hand
the prevalence of the westerly winds in high southern latitudes left me
no reason to doubt of making a quick passage to the Cape of Good Hope and
thence to the eastward round New Holland.

Tuesday 22.

Having maturely considered all circumstances I determined to bear away
for the Cape of Good Hope; and at five o'clock on the evening of the
22nd, the wind then blowing strong at west, I ordered the helm to be put
a weather, to the great joy of every person on board. Our sicklist at
this time had increased to eight, mostly with rheumatic complaints: in
other respects the people were in good health, though exceedingly jaded.

The passage round Cape Horn into the South Seas during the summer months
has seldom been attended with difficulty and is to be preferred in the
moderate seasons to the more distant route to the eastward round the Cape
of Good Hope and New Holland. If we had been one month earlier, or
perhaps less, I doubt not but we should have effected our passage.

The soundings that are met with off the coast of America, from the
latitude of 36 degrees south to the southward, are very convenient to
enable ships to judge of their distance from the land, as thick fogs are
very frequent near that coast. If the winds are favourable, to go through
Straits le Maire must considerably shorten the passage round Cape Horn,
as all the distance saved is so much gained to the westward. I am
informed that several harbours have been lately discovered by the South
Sea whalers on the north side of Staten Island that afford safe anchorage
with supplies of wood and water.

While we were off Cape Horn I did not observe that our situation was at
all affected by currents.


CHAPTER 3.

Passage towards the Cape of Good Hope and Search after Tristan da Cunha.
Arrival at False Bay.
Occurrences there.
Reports concerning the Grosvenor's People.
Departure from the Cape.

1788. April. Friday 25.

The westerly winds and stormy weather continuing gave me no reason to
repent of my determination. On the 25th at noon we were in latitude 54
degrees 16 minutes south and longitude 57 degrees 4 minutes west. The
nearest of the Falkland Islands by my reckoning then bore north 13
degrees west; distance 23 leagues. Our stock of water being sufficient to
serve us to the Cape of Good Hope I did not think it worth while to stop
at these islands as the refreshment we might obtain there would scarce
repay us for the expense of time: we therefore continued our course
towards the north-east and east-north-east.

May. Friday 9.

On the 9th of May at eight o'clock in the evening we were near the
situation of Tristan da Cunha, our latitude being 37 degrees 7 minutes
south and longitude 15 degrees 26 minutes west. All the afternoon the
weather had been clear enough for land of a moderate height to be seen at
least seven leagues; I therefore concluded that we had not yet passed the
meridian of the island; for the most western position given to it from
any authority is 15 degrees 0 minutes west.

As I wished to make this island we kept our wind on different tacks
during the night, that we might be nearly in the same place at daylight
in the morning as on the preceding evening: in the morning no land being
in sight we continued to steer to the eastward.

Saturday 10.

We ran on all day having clear weather but without seeing anything to
indicate our being near land. At noon our latitude observed was 37
degrees 27 minutes south which, being more to the southward than we had
reason to expect, I altered the course to the northward and steered
north-east all the afternoon. At six o'clock in the evening we were in
latitude 37 degrees 0 minutes south and longitude 12 degrees 42 minutes
west, having a clear horizon but not the least sign of being in the
neighbourhood of land. With the night came thick rainy weather and we
were now to the eastward of the situation ascribed to Tristan da Cunha; I
therefore determined to give over the search and to resume our course
towards the Cape of Good Hope.

The island of Tristan da Cunha, by Robertson's Elements, is laid down in
37 degrees 12 minutes south latitude and 13 degrees 23 minutes west
longitude. In Captain Cook's general map, prefixed to his last voyage, it
is placed in the same latitude but in 15 degrees west longitude. From our
track and the clearness of the weather I am convinced, if the latitude
ascribed to it as above is correct, that it is not to be found between
the meridians of 16 degrees 30 minutes west and 12 degrees 30 minutes
west. On the 13th I had a number of lunar observations for the longitude,
the mean of which agreed exactly with the timekeeper.*

(*Footnote. In Mr. Dalrymple's Collection of Plans which I had not with
me the northernmost of the Islands of Tristan d'Acunha is placed in
latitude 37 degrees 22 minutes south and longitude 13 degrees 17 minutes
west. I think it probable we missed them by being too much to the
northward.)

In this passage the weather was generally so cloudy that I had few
opportunities to make observations of any kind except for the noon
latitudes. I could not determine when we crossed the line of no
variation. The two nearest observations to it were: the first in 39
degrees 51 minutes south latitude and 26 degrees 11 minutes west
longitude, where the variation of the compass was found to be 3 degrees
17 minutes east; and the other in latitude 35 degrees 30 minutes south
and longitude 5 degrees 21 minutes west, where I observed the variation
11 degrees 35 minutes west; between these we had no intermediate
observation for the variation.

Thursday 22.

At two in the afternoon we saw the Table Mountain of the Cape of Good
Hope. As it is reckoned unsafe riding in Table Bay at this time of year I
steered for False Bay. The next evening we anchored in the outer part.

Saturday 24.

And on the forenoon of the 24th got the ship secured in Simon's Bay,
which is in the inner part of False Bay. When moored, Noah's ark bore
south 35 degrees east three-quarters of a mile, and the hospital south 72
west. We found lying here one outward bound Dutch Indiaman, five other
Dutch ships, and a French ship.

After saluting the fort, which was returned by an equal number of guns, I
went on shore and dispatches were sent away to Cape Town to acquaint the
governor of our arrival. A Dutch ship at this time lying in Table Bay
bound for Europe, I sent letters by her to the Admiralty. It is very
unusual for ships to be in Table Bay so late in the year, on account of
the strong north-west winds. April is the time limited.

I gave the necessary directions for getting our wants supplied. The ship
required to be caulked in every part for she was become so leaky that we
had been obliged to pump every hour in our passage from Cape Horn. This
we immediately set about, as well as repairing our sails and rigging. The
severe weather we had met with and the leakiness of the ship made it
necessary to examine into the state of all the stores and provisions. Of
the latter a good deal was found damaged, particularly the bread. The
timekeeper I took on shore to ascertain its rate, and other instruments
to make the necessary astronomical observations. Fresh meat, with soft
bread and plenty of vegetables, were issued daily to the ship's company
the whole time we remained here. A few days after our arrival I went over
to Cape Town and waited on his excellency M. Vander Graaf, the governor,
who obligingly arranged matters so much to our advantage that we scarcely
felt the inconvenience of being at a distance from the Cape Town, whence
we received all our supplies.

The Cape Town is considerably increased within the last eight years. Its
respectability with regard to strength has kept pace with its other
enlargements and rendered it very secure against any attempt which is not
made with considerable force. Great attention is paid to military order
and discipline; and monthly signals are established to communicate with
their shipping as they arrive near the coast that they may not run
unawares into the hands of an enemy. I found everything much dearer than
when I was here in 1780. Sheep cost four Spanish dollars each and were so
small that it answered better to purchase the mutton for the ship's daily
use at fourpence per pound.

During our stay here I took care to procure seeds and plants that would
be valuable at Otaheite and the different places we might touch at in our
way thither. In this I was greatly assisted by colonel Gordon, the
commander of the troops. In company with this gentleman the loss of the
Grosvenor East Indiaman was mentioned: on this subject colonel Gordon
expressed great concern that from anything he had said hopes were still
entertained to flatter the affectionate wishes of the surviving friends
of those unfortunate people. He said that in his travels into the Caffre
country he had met with a native who described to him that there was a
white woman among his countrymen who had a child, and that she frequently
embraced the child and cried most violently. This was all he (the
colonel) could understand and, being then on his return home with his
health much impaired by fatigue, the only thing that he could do was to
make a friend of the native by presents and promises of reward on
condition that he would take a letter to this woman and bring him back an
answer. Accordingly he wrote letters in English, French, and Dutch
desiring that some sign or mark might be returned, either by writing with
a burnt stick or by any means she should be able to devise, to satisfy
him that she was there; and that on receiving such token from her every
effort should be made to ensure her safety and escape. But the Caffre,
although apparently delighted with the commission which he had
undertaken, never returned, nor has the colonel ever heard anything more
of him, though he had been instructed in methods of conveying information
through the Hottentot country.

To this account, that I may not again have occasion to introduce so
melancholy a subject, I shall add the little information I received
respecting it when I revisited the Cape in my return towards Europe. A
reputable farmer of the name of Holhousen, who lives at Swellendam, eight
days journey from the Cape, had information from some Caffre Hottentots
that at a kraal or village in their country there were white men and
women. On this intelligence Mr. Holhousen asked permission of the
governor to make an expedition with some of the farmers into the country,
requiring a thousand rix-dollars to bear his expenses. The governor
referred him to Mr. Wocke, the Landros of Graaf Rienet, a new colony in
his way. But from the place where Mr. Holhousen lives to the Landros, Mr.
Wocke's residence, is a month's journey, which he did not choose to
undertake at an uncertainty, as Mr. Wocke might have disapproved of the
enterprise. It was in October last that Mr. Holhousen offered to go on
this service. He was one of the party who went along the sea-coast in
search of these unfortunate people when a few of them first made their
appearance at the Cape. I am however informed that the Dutch farmers are
fond of making expeditions into the country, that they may have
opportunities of taking away cattle; and this I apprehend to be one of
the chief reasons why undertakings of this kind are not encouraged.

On the 13th of June the Dublin East Indiaman arrived from England, on
board of which ship was a party of the 77th regiment under the command of
colonel Balfour.

The result of my lunar observations gave for the longitude of Simon's Bay
18 degrees 48 minutes 34 seconds east; the latitude 34 degrees 11 minutes
34 seconds south. The timekeeper likewise made the longitude 18 degrees
47 minutes east. The longitude as established by former observations is
18 degrees 33 minutes east. The variation of the compass on shore was 24
degrees 4 minutes west; but on board of the ship it was only 22 degrees
28 minutes west. The time of high-water was three-quarters past two on
the full and change and it then flowed six feet.

With respect to the Cape Promontory it lies about three miles east of the
meridian of Simon's Town. All the tables of latitude and longitude place
the Cape in 34 degrees 29 minutes south latitude; but from many
observations off it with good instruments I make it to lie in 34 degrees
23 minutes south, which agrees with its situation as laid down in major
Rennel's map. The part which I call the Cape is the southernmost point of
the land between Table Bay and False Bay; but the Dutch consider the
westernmost part of the coast to be the Cape.

Sunday 29.

On the 29th, being ready for sea, I took the timekeeper and instruments
on board. The error of the timekeeper was 3 minutes 33 seconds, 2 too slow for
the mean time at Greenwich, and its rate of going 3 seconds per day,
losing. The thermometer during our stay here was from 51 to 66 degrees.

July. Tuesday 1.

We had been thirty-eight days at this place, and my people had received
all the advantage that could be derived from the refreshments of every
kind that are here to be met with. We sailed at four o'clock this
afternoon, and saluted the platform with thirteen guns as we ran out of
the bay, which were returned.


CHAPTER 4.

Passage towards Van Diemen's Land.
Make the Island of St. Paul.
Arrival in Adventure Bay.
Natives seen.
Sail from Van Diemen's Land.

1788. July.

We lost sight of the land the day after leaving False Bay and steered
towards the east-south-east, having variable winds the first week with
much thunder, lightning and rain. The remainder of this passage the winds
were mostly between the south and west blowing strong. There were almost
every day great numbers of pintada, albatrosses, blue petrels, and other
oceanic birds about us; but it was observed that if the wind came from
the northward, only for a few hours, the birds generally left us, and
their presence again was the forerunner of a southerly wind.

Sunday 13.

The variation of the compass was 30 degrees 34 minutes west which was the
greatest variation we found in this track. Our latitude 36 degrees 28
minutes south and longitude 39 degrees 0 minutes east.

Sunday 20.

The latitude at noon was 40 degrees 30 minutes south and longitude 60
degrees 7 minutes east. We were at this time scudding under the fore-sail
and close-reefed main-top-sail, the wind blowing strong from the west. An
hour after noon the gale increased and blew with so much violence that
the ship was almost driven forecastle under before we could get the sails
clewed up. As soon as the sails were taken in we brought the ship to the
wind, lowered the lower yards, and got the top-gallant-masts upon deck,
which eased the ship very much.

Monday 21.

We remained lying to till eight the next morning when we bore away under
a reefed fore-sail. In the afternoon the sea ran so high that it became
very unsafe to stand on: we therefore brought to the wind again, and
remained lying to all night without accident excepting that the man at
the steerage was thrown over the wheel and much bruised.

Tuesday 22.

Towards noon the violence of the storm abated and we again bore away
under the reefed fore-sail. Our latitude at noon 38 degrees 49 minutes
south: in the afternoon saw some whales.

We continued running to the eastward in this parallel, it being my
intention to make the island St. Paul.

Monday 28.

On Monday the 28th at six in the morning we saw the island bearing east
by north 12 leagues distant: between 10 and 11 o'clock we ran along the
south side at about a league distant from the shore. There was a verdure
that covered the higher parts of the land, but I believe it was nothing
more than moss which is commonly found on the tops of most rocky islands
in these latitudes. We saw several whales near the shore. The extent of
this island is five miles from east to west; and about two or three from
north to south. As we passed the east end we saw a remarkable high
sugarloaf rock, abreast of which I have been informed is good anchorage
in 23 fathoms, the east point bearing south-west by south by true
compass. I had this information from the captain of a Dutch packet in
which I returned to Europe. He likewise said there was good fresh water
on the island and a hot spring which boiled fish in as great perfection
as on a fire. By his account the latitude which he observed in the road
is 38 degrees 39 minutes south; and from the anchoring place the island
of Amsterdam was in sight to the northward. We had fair weather all the
forenoon, but just at noon a squall came on which was unfavourable for
our observation. I had however two sets of double altitudes and a good
altitude exactly at noon according to the timekeeper. The result of these
gave for the latitude of the centre of St. Paul 38 degrees 47 minutes
south. The longitude I make 77 degrees 39 minutes east. The variation of
the compass, taking the mean of what it was observed to be the day before
we saw the island and the day after, is 19 degrees 30 minutes west.

At noon we were three leagues past the island. We kept on towards the
east-south-east, and for several days continued to see rock-weed, which
is remarked to be generally the case after ships pass St. Paul's; but to
the westward of it very seldom any is seen.

August. Wednesday 13.

In latitude 44 degrees 16 minutes south, longitude 122 degrees 7 minutes
east, I observed the variation of the compass to be 6 degrees 23 minutes
west. I had no opportunity to observe it again till in the latitude of 43
degrees 56 minutes south, longitude 133 degrees 16 minutes east, when it
was 1 degree 38 minutes east; so that we had passed the line of no
variation. In 1780, on board the Resolution in latitude 44 degrees 23
minutes south, longitude 131 degrees 28 minutes east, the variation was
observed 6 degrees 0 minutes west, which is a remarkable difference. We
had much bad weather with snow and hail, and in our approach to Van
Diemen's Land nothing was seen to indicate the nearness of the coast,
except a seal, when we were within the distance of 20 leagues.

Tuesday 19.

At ten o'clock this afternoon we saw the rock named the Mewstone, that
lies near the south-west cape of Van Diemen's Land, bearing north-east
about six leagues. The wind blew strong from the north-west. As soon as
we had passed the Mewstone we were sheltered from a very heavy sea which
ran from the westward. At eight o'clock at night we were abreast of the
south cape when the wind became light and variable. Saw several fires
inland.

The Mewstone is a high bold rock that lies five leagues to the south-east
of the south-west cape and is the part that all ships bound this way
should endeavour to make. Its latitude is 43 degrees 46 or 47 minutes.
Several islands lie to the northward between that and the main, among
which, bearing north by west from the Mewstone, is a high rock much
resembling it; and north-north-east from the Mewstone, on the mainland,
is a remarkable high mountain, which in this direction appears notched
like a cock's comb; but as viewed from the eastward seems round.

Wednesday 20.

All the 20th we were endeavouring to get into Adventure Bay but were
prevented by variable winds. The next morning at five o'clock we anchored
in the outer part, and at sunrise weighed again: at noon we anchored well
in the bay and moored the ship, Penguin Island bearing north 57 1/2
degrees east, about two miles distant; Cape Frederic Henry north 23
degrees east; and the mouth of the Lagoon south 16 degrees east.

In our passage from the Cape of Good Hope the winds were mostly from the
westward with very boisterous weather: but one great advantage that this
season of the year has over the summer months is in being free from fogs.
I have already remarked that the approach of strong southerly winds is
announced by many kinds of birds of the albatross or petrel tribe, and
the abatement of the gale, or a shift of wind to the northward, by their
keeping away. The thermometer also very quickly shows when a change of
these winds may be expected by varying sometimes six and seven degrees in
its height. I have reason to believe that, after we passed the island St.
Paul, there was a westerly current; the ship being every day to the
westward of the reckoning, which in the whole, from St. Paul to Van
Diemen's land, made a difference of four degrees between the longitude by
the reckoning and the true longitude.

Thursday 21.

The ship being moored I went in a boat to look out for the most
convenient place to wood and water at, which I found to be at the west
end of the beach: for the surf, though considerable, was less there than
at any other part of the bay. The water was in a gully about sixty yards
from the beach; it was perfectly good but, being only a collection from
the rains, the place is always dry in the summer months; for we found no
water in it when I was here with Captain Cook in January 1777. We had
very little success in hauling the seine; about twenty small flounders,
and flat-headed fish called foxes were all that were taken.

I found no signs of the natives having lately frequented this bay or of
any European vessels having been here since the Resolution and Discovery
in 1777. From some of the old trunks of trees then cut down I saw shoots
about twenty-five feet high and fourteen inches in circumference.

In the evening I returned on board.

Friday 22.

The next morning, the 22nd, at daylight, a party was sent on shore for
wooding and watering under the command of Mr. Christian and the gunner;
and I directed that one man should be constantly employed in washing the
people's clothes. There was so much surf that the wood was obliged to be
rafted off in bundles to the boat. Mr. Nelson informed me that in his
walks today he saw a tree in a very healthy state which he measured and
found to be thirty-three feet and a half in girt; its height was
proportioned to its bulk.

Saturday 23.

The surf was rather greater than yesterday which very much interrupted
our wooding and watering. Nelson today picked up a male opossum that had
been recently killed, or had died, for we could not perceive any wound
unless it had received a blow on the back where there was a bare place
about the size of a shilling. It measured fourteen inches from the ears
to the beginning of the tail which was exactly the same length.

Most of the forest trees were at this time shedding their bark. There are
three kinds, which are distinguished from each other by their leaves,
though the wood appears to be the same. Many of them are full one hundred
and fifty feet high; but most of those that we cut down were decayed at
the heart. There are, besides the forest trees, several other kinds that
are firm good wood and may be cut for most purposes except masts; neither
are the forest trees good for masts, on account of their weight, and the
difficulty of finding them thoroughly sound. Mr. Nelson asserted that
they shed their bark every year, and that they increase more from the
seed than by suckers.

I found the tide made a difference of full two feet in the height of the
water in the lake at the back of the beach. At high water it was very
brackish, but at low tide it was perfectly fresh to the taste, and soap
showed no sign of its being the least impregnated. We had better success
in fishing on board the ship than by hauling the seine on shore; for with
hooks and lines a number of fine rock-cod were caught. I saw today
several eagles, some beautiful blue-plumaged herons, and a great variety
of parakeets. A few oyster-catchers and gulls were generally about the
beach, and in the lake a few wild ducks.

Monday 25.

Being in want of plank I directed a saw-pit to be dug and employed some
of the people to saw trees into plank. The greater part of this week the
winds were moderate with unsettled weather.

Friday 29.

On Friday it blew strong from the south-west with rain, thunder, and
lightning. We continued to catch fish in sufficient quantities for
everybody and had better success with the seine. We were fortunate also
in angling in the lake where we caught some very fine tench. Some of the
people felt a sickness from eating mussels that were gathered from the
rocks; but I believe it was occasioned by eating too many. We found some
spider-crabs, most of them not good, being the female sort and out of
season. The males were tolerably good and were known by the smallness of
their two fore-claws or feeders. We saw the trunk of a dead tree on which
had been cut A.D. 1773. The figures were very distinct; even the slips
made with the knife were discernible. This must have been done by some of
captain Furneaux's people in March 1773, fifteen years before. The marks
of the knife remaining so unaltered, I imagine the tree must have been
dead when it was cut; but it serves to show the durability of the wood
for it was perfectly sound at this time. I shot two gannets: these birds
were of the same size as those in England; their colour is a beautiful
white, with the wings and tail tipped with jet black and the top and back
of the head of a very fine yellow. Their feet were black with four claws,
on each of which was a yellow line the whole length of the foot. The bill
was four inches long, without nostrils, and very taper and sharp-pointed.

The east side of the bay being not so thick of wood as the other parts,
and the soil being good, I fixed on it, at Nelson's recommendation, as
the most proper situation for planting some of the fruit-trees which I
had brought from the Cape of Good Hope. A circumstance much against
anything succeeding here is that in the dry season the fires made by the
natives are apt to communicate to the dried grass and underwood, and to
spread in such a manner as to endanger everything that cannot bear a
severe scorching. We however chose what we thought the safest situations,
and planted three fine young apple-trees, nine vines, six plantain-trees,
a number of orange and lemon-seed, cherry-stones, plum, peach, and
apricot-stones, pumpkins, also two sorts of Indian corn, and apple and
pear kernels. The ground is well adapted for the trees, being of a rich
loamy nature. The spot where we made our plantation was clear of
underwood; and we marked the trees that stood nearest to the different
things which were planted. Nelson followed the circuit of the bay,
planting in such places as appeared most eligible. I have great hopes
that some of these articles will succeed. The particular situations I had
described in my survey of this place, but I was unfortunately prevented
from bringing it home. Near the watering place likewise we planted on a
flat, which appeared a favourable situation, some onions, cabbage-roots,
and potatoes.

For some days past a number of whales were seen in the bay. They were of
the same kind as those we had generally met with before, having two
blow-holes on the back of the head.

September. Monday 1.

On the night of the 1st of September we observed for the first time signs
of the natives being in the neighbourhood. Fires were seen on the low
land near Cape Frederick Henry, and at daylight we saw the natives with
our glasses. As I expected they would come round to us I remained all the
forenoon near the wooding and watering parties, making observations, the
morning being very favourable for that purpose. I was however
disappointed in my conjecture for the natives did not appear, and there
was too great a surf for a boat to land on the part where we had seen
them.

Tuesday 2.

The natives not coming near us, I determined to go after them, and we set
out in a boat towards Cape Frederick Henry, where we arrived about eleven
o'clock. I found landing impracticable and therefore came to a grapnel,
in hopes of their coming to us, for we had passed several fires. After
waiting near an hour I was surprised to see Nelson's assistant come out
of the wood: he had wandered thus far in search of plants and told me
that he had met with some of the natives. Soon after we heard their
voices like the cackling of geese, and twenty persons came out of the
wood, twelve of whom went round to some rocks where the boat could get
nearer to the shore than we then were. Those who remained behind were
women.

We approached within twenty yards of them, but there was no possibility
of landing and I could only throw to the shore, tied up in paper, the
presents which I intended for them. I showed the different articles as I
tied them up, but they would not untie the paper till I made an
appearance of leaving them. They then opened the parcels and, as they
took the articles out, placed them on their heads. On seeing this I
returned towards them when they instantly put everything out of their
hands and would not appear to take notice of anything that we had given
them. After throwing a few more beads and nails on shore I made signs for
them to go to the ship, and they likewise made signs for me to land, but
as this could not be effected I left them, in hopes of a nearer interview
at the watering-place.

When they first came in sight they made a prodigious clattering in their
speech and held their arms over their heads. They spoke so quick that I
could not catch one single word they uttered. We recollected one man whom
we had formerly seen among the party of the natives that came to us in
1777, and who is particularised in the account of Captain Cook's last
voyage for his humour and deformity. Some of them had a small stick, two
or three feet long, in their hands, but no other weapon.

Their colour, as Captain Cook remarks, is a dull black: their skin is
scarified about their shoulders and breast. They were of a middle
stature, or rather below it. One of them was distinguished by his body
being coloured with red ochre, but all the others were painted black with
a kind of soot which was laid on so thick over their faces and shoulders
that it is difficult to say what they were like.

They ran very nimbly over the rocks, had a very quick sight, and caught
the small beads and nails which I threw to them with great dexterity.
They talked to us sitting on their heels with their knees close into
their armpits and were perfectly naked.

In my return towards the ship I landed at the point of the harbour near
Penguin Island, and from the hills saw the water on the other side of the
low isthmus of Cape Frederick Henry, which forms the bay of that name. It
is very extensive and in, or near, the middle of the bay there is a low
island. From this spot it has the appearance of being a very good and
convenient harbour.

The account which I had from Brown, the botanist's assistant, was that in
his search for plants he had met an old man, a young woman, and two or
three children. The old man at first appeared alarmed, but became
familiar on being presented with a knife. He nevertheless sent away the
young woman who went very reluctantly. He saw some miserable wigwams, in
which were nothing but a few kangaroo skins spread on the ground, and a
basket made of rushes.

Among the wood that we cut here we found many scorpions and centipedes,
with numerous black ants that were an inch long. We saw no mosquitoes,
though in the summer months they are very troublesome.

What is called the New Zealand tea plant grew here in great abundance; so
that it was not only gathered and dried to use as tea but made excellent
brooms. It bears a small pointed leaf of a pleasant smell, and its seed
is contained in a berry, about the size of a pea, notched into five equal
parts on the top. The soil on the west and south sides of the bay is
black mould with a mixture of fine white sand and is very rich. The trees
are lofty and large, and the underwood grows so close together that in
many places it is impassable. The east side of the bay is a rich loamy
soil; but near the tops of the hills is very much encumbered with stones
and rocks: the underwood thinly placed and small. The trees on the south,
south-east, and south-west sides of the hills grow to a larger size than
those that are exposed to the opposite points; for the sides of the trees
open or exposed to the north winds are naked with few branches; while the
other sides are in a flourishing state. From this I do not infer that the
equatorial are more hurtful than the polar winds; but that the trees by
their situation were more sheltered from the one for from the other.

Wednesday 3.

A calm prevented our sailing today. The friendly interview which we had
had with the natives made me expect that they would have paid us a visit;
but we saw nothing more of them except fires in the night upon the low
land to the northward.

The result of the observations which I made here, reduced to Penguin
Island, place it in 43 degrees 21 minutes 11 seconds south latitude and
in longitude 147 degrees 33 minutes 29 seconds east, which scarcely
differs from the observations made in 1777. The variation of the compass
observed on shore was 8 degrees 38 minutes east; and on board the ship 8
degrees 29 minutes east. It was high-water at the change of the moon at
49 minutes past six in the morning. The rise was two feet eight inches.
Southerly winds, if of any continuance, make a considerable difference in
the height of the tides.

Thursday 4.

This forenoon, having a pleasant breeze at north-west, we weighed anchor
and sailed out of Adventure Bay. At noon the southernmost part of Maria's
Isles bore north 52 degrees east, about five leagues distant; Penguin
Island south 86 degrees west; and Cape Frederick Henry north 65 degrees
west. In this position we had soundings at 57 fathoms, a sandy bottom.
Latitude observed 43 degrees 22 minutes south.

The southern part of Maria's Islands lie in latitude 43 degrees 16
minutes south. The country is not in general woody, but in some of the
interior parts there appeared great abundance. Among these islands I have
no doubt of there being many convenient places for shipping. On the east
side in latitude 42 degrees 42 minutes south and longitude 148 degrees 24
minutes east in July, 1789, Captain Cox of the Mercury found a convenient
and secure harbour from all winds which he named Oyster Bay. Here he
found wood, water, and fish in great abundance. It has two outlets and
lies north, a little easterly, distant 34 miles from the
south-easternmost island, or point, seen from Adventure Bay.

Adventure Bay is a convenient and safe place for any number of ships to
take in wood and water during the summer months: but in the winter, when
the southerly winds are strong, the surf, on all parts of the shore,
makes the landing exceedingly troublesome. The bay of Frederick Henry may
perhaps be found preferable, as it appears to be equally easy of access.
The soundings in Adventure Bay are very regular: near the west shore are
some patches of weed but no shoal or danger, the depth on them being from
five to nine fathoms.

CHAPTER 5.

Rocky Islands discovered.
See the Island Maitea and arrive at Otaheite.
Ship crowded by the Natives.

1788. September.

Being clear of the land we steered towards the east-south-east, it being
my intention to pass to the southward of New Zealand, as I expected in
that route to meet with constant westerly winds; in which however I was
disappointed, for they proved variable and frequently from the eastward
blowing strong, with thick misty weather. The thermometer varied from 41
to 46 degrees.

Sunday 14.

On the 14th at noon we were in 49 degrees 24 minutes south latitude and
in 168 degrees 3 minutes east longitude, which is on the same meridian
with the south end of New Zealand. We altered our course, steering to the
northward of east, and frequently saw rock-weed which I supposed to have
drifted from New Zealand. The sea now became rougher from our being
exposed to a long swell which came from the north-east.

Friday 19.

On the 19th at daylight we discovered a cluster of small rocky islands
bearing east by north four leagues distant from us. We had seen no birds
or anything to indicate the nearness of land except patches of rock-weed,
for which the vicinity of New Zealand sufficiently accounted. The wind
being at north-east prevented our near approach to these isles; so that
we were not less than three leagues distant in passing to the southward
of them. The weather was too thick to see distinctly: their extent was
only 3 1/2 miles from east to west and about half a league from north to
south: their number including the smaller ones was thirteen. I could not
observe any verdure on any of them: there were white spots like patches
of snow but, as Captain Cook, in describing the land of New Zealand, near
Cape South, says, in many places there are patches like white marble, it
is probable that what we saw might be of the same kind as what he had
observed. The westernmost of these islands is the largest; they are of
sufficient height to be seen at the distance of seven leagues from a
ship's deck. When the easternmost bore north I tried for soundings, being
then 10 miles distant from the nearest of them, and found bottom at 75
fathoms, a fine white sand: and again at noon, having run six leagues
more to the east-south-east, we had soundings at 104 fathoms, a fine
brimstone-coloured sand. The latitude of these islands is 47 degrees 44
minutes south; their longitude 179 degrees 7 minutes east, which is about
145 leagues to the east of the Traps, near the south end of New Zealand.
Variation of the compass here 17 degrees east. While in sight of the
islands we saw some penguins, and a white kind of gull with a forked
tail. Captain Cook's track in 1773 was near this spot, but he did not see
the islands: he saw seals and penguins hereabouts, but considered New
Zealand to be the nearest land. I have named them after the ship the
Bounty Isles.

Sunday 21.

This day we saw a seal, some rock-weed, and a great many albatrosses. I
tried for soundings but found no bottom at 230 fathoms depth. Our
latitude 47 degrees 32 minutes south, longitude 182 degrees 36 minutes
east.

October. Thursday 2.

Were in 40 degrees 27 minutes south latitude and 214 degrees 4 minutes
east longitude. It being calm, and a number of small blubbers about the
ship, I took up some in a bucket, but I saw no difference between them
and the common blubbers in the West Indies. We frequently in the
night-time observed the sea to be covered with luminous spots caused by
prodigious quantities of small blubbers that, from the strings which
extend from them, emit a light like the blaze of a candle, while the body
continues perfectly dark.

Friday 3.

The 3rd in the morning we saw a seal. Captain Cook has remarked seeing
seaweed when nearly in the same place. Our latitude 40 degrees 21 minutes
south, longitude 215 degrees east. Variation of the compass 7 degrees 45
minutes east. Being now well to the eastward of the Society Islands I
steered more to the northward.

We continued to have the southern oceanic birds accompany us and a few
whales. The people caught albatrosses and fattened them in the same
manner which they had done when off Cape Horn. Some of these measured
near eight feet between the tips of the wings when spread.

Thursday 9.

On Thursday the 9th we had the misfortune to lose one of our seamen,
James Valentine, who died in the night of an asthmatic complaint. This
poor man had been one of the most robust people on board until our
arrival at Adventure Bay, where he first complained of some slight
indisposition for which he was bled, and got better. Some time afterwards
the arm in which he had been bled became painful and inflamed: the
inflammation increased, with a hollow cough, and extreme difficulty of
breathing, to his death.

Monday 13.

The 13th in the afternoon we saw two land birds like what are called
sand-larks. Our latitude at this time was 28 degrees 3 minutes south and
longitude 223 degrees 26 minutes east.

Tuesday 14.

The next morning we saw a tropic bird and some fish. The winds were light
and variable with calms from this time to the 19th, when a breeze sprang
up from the north-east, which gradually came round to the eastward and
proved to be the tradewind. Our latitude on the 19th at noon was 24
degrees 13 minutes south, longitude 222 degrees 17 minutes east.
Variation of the compass 5 degrees 19 minutes east.

Saturday 25.

On the 25th at half-past seven in the morning we saw the Island Maitea,
called Osnaburg by Captain Wallis, who first discovered it. At noon it
bore south-west by west one-quarter west, six miles distant. Our latitude
17 degrees 50 minutes south, longitude 212 degrees 24 minutes east.
Variation five degrees east. As Captain Wallis and Captain Cook had both
passed near the south side, I ran along the north side, which is
remarkably steep. The island is high and round and not more than three
miles in its greatest extent. The south side, where the declivity from
the hill is more gradual, is the chief place of residence of the natives;
but the north side, from the very summit down to the sea, is so steep
that it can afford no support to the inhabitants. We steered pretty close
in to the northward of the east end, where we saw but few habitations: a
very neat house on a small eminence, delightfully situated in a grove of
coconut-trees, particularly attracted our notice. About twenty of the
natives followed us along shore, waving and showing large pieces of
cloth; but the surf on the shore was too high to think of having any
communication with them. I observed a great number of coconut-trees but
did not see one plantain-tree. There were other trees but of what kind we
could not distinguish: near the east end are two remarkable rocks, and a
reef runs off to the eastward about half a league.

The latitude of Maitea is 17 degrees 53 minutes south; and by our
timekeeper its longitude is 1 degree 24 minutes east from Point Venus.
Variation of the compass 5 degrees 36 minutes east.

We continued our course to the westward, and at six in the evening saw
Otaheite bearing west three-quarters south; the island Maitea, then in
sight, bearing east half south, eight leagues distant. As there was great
probability that we should remain a considerable time at Otaheite, it
could not be expected that the intercourse of my people with the natives
should be of a very reserved nature: I therefore ordered that every
person should be examined by the surgeon, and had the satisfaction to
learn from his report that they were all perfectly free from any venereal
complaint.

Sunday 26.

On the 26th at four o'clock in the morning, having run twenty-five
leagues from Maitea, we brought to till daylight, when we saw Point Venus
bearing south-west by west, distant about four leagues. As we drew near a
great number of canoes came off to us. Their first enquiries were if we
were tyos, which signifies friends; and whether we came from Pretanie
(their pronunciation of Britain) or from Lima: they were no sooner
satisfied in this than they crowded on board in vast numbers,
notwithstanding our endeavours to prevent it, as we were working the ship
in; and in less than ten minutes the deck was so full that I could scarce
find my own people. At nine in the forenoon we were obliged to anchor in
the outer part of Matavai Bay, in thirteen fathoms, being prevented by
light variable winds from placing the ship in a proper berth. In this
station the west part of One-tree hill bore south by east half east one
mile distant.

This passage of fifty-two days from Van Diemen's Land may be rated as
moderate sailing. We passed New Zealand with the spring equinox and the
winds, though strong, were at no time violent. To the southward of 40
degrees 0 minutes south they were variable; between the latitudes of 40
and 33 degrees south the wind kept in the north-west quarter; afterwards
till we got into the trade the winds were variable, mostly from the
eastward, but light and inclinable to calms. The ship was 3 degrees 22
minutes in longitude to the eastward of the dead reckoning, which the
timekeeper almost invariably proved to be owing to a current giving us
more easting than the log. Our track was as distant from any course of
former ships as I could conveniently make it and, though we made no new
discoveries, except the small cluster of islands near New Zealand, yet in
other parts of the track, as has been noticed, we met with signs of being
in the neighbourhood of land.

It may not be unworthy of remark that the whole distance which the ship
had run by the log, in direct and contrary courses, from leaving England
to our anchoring at Otaheite, was twenty-seven thousand and eighty-six
miles which, on an average, is at the rate of a hundred and eight miles
each twenty-four hours.

1788. October. Sunday 26.

The ship being anchored, our number of visitors continued to increase;
but as yet we saw no person that we could recollect to have been of much
consequence. Some inferior chiefs made me presents of a few hogs and I
made them presents in return. We were supplied with coconuts in great
abundance but breadfruit was scarce.

Many enquiries were made after Captain Cook, Sir Joseph Banks, and many
of their former friends. They said a ship had been here from which they
had learnt that Captain Cook was dead; but the circumstances of his death
they did not appear to be acquainted with; and I had given particular
directions to my officers and ship's company that they should not be
mentioned. The ship spoken of, they informed me, stayed at Otaheite one
month and had been gone four months, by some of their accounts; according
to others only three months. The captain they called Tonah. I understood
likewise from them that Lieutenant Watts was in the ship who, having been
here in the Resolution with Captain Cook, was well known to them. One of
my first enquiries, as will naturally be imagined, was after our friend
Omai; and it was a sensible mortification and disappointment to me to
hear that not only Omai, but both the New Zealand boys who had been left
with him, were dead. Everyone agreed in their information that they died
a natural death. Otoo, who was the chief of Matavai when Captain Cook was
here the last time, was absent at another part of the island; they told
me messengers were sent to inform him of our arrival, and that he was
expected to return soon. There appeared among the natives in general
great goodwill towards us, and they seemed to be much rejoiced at our
arrival. This whole day we experienced no instance of dishonesty. We were
so much crowded that I could not undertake to remove to a more proper
station without danger of disobliging our visitors by desiring them to
leave the ship: this business was therefore deferred till the next
morning.

Monday 27.

Early in the morning, before the natives began to flock off to us, we
weighed anchor to work farther into the bay, and moored at about a
quarter of a mile distance from the shore; Point Venus bearing north 16
degrees east; the west part of One-tree hill south-west by south; and the
point of the reef north 37 degrees west; the ship lying in seven fathoms
water.

Several chiefs now came on board and expressed great pleasure at seeing
me. Among these were Otow, the father of Otoo, and Oreepyah, his brother;
also another chief of Matavai called Poeeno: and to these men I made
presents. Two messengers likewise arrived from Otoo to acquaint me of his
being on his way to the ship; each of whom brought me as a present from
Otoo a small pig and a young plantain-tree as a token of friendship. The
ship was now plentifully supplied with provisions; every person having as
much as he could consume.

As soon as the ship was secured I went on shore with the chief Poeeno,
and accompanied by a multitude of the natives. He conducted me to the
place where we had fixed our tents in 1777 and desired that I would now
appropriate the spot to the same use. We then went across the beach and
through a walk delightfully shaded with breadfruit trees to his own
house. Here we found two women at work staining a piece of cloth red.
These I found were his wife and her sister. They desired me to sit down
on a mat which was spread for the purpose, and with great kindness
offered me refreshments. I received the congratulations of several
strangers who came to us and behaved with great decorum and attention.
The people however thronged about the house in such numbers that I was
much incommoded by the heat, which being observed they immediately drew
back. Among the crowd I saw a man who had lost his arm just above the
elbow; the stump was well covered and the cure seemed as perfect as could
be expected from the greatest professional skill.

I made enquiries about the cattle that had been left here by Captain
Cook, but the accounts I received were very unfavourable and so various
that for the present I shall forebear speaking of them. After staying
about an hour I got up to take leave, when the women in a very obliging
manner came to me with a mat and a piece of their finest cloth, which
they put on me after the Otaheite fashion. When I was thus dressed they
each of them took one of my hands, and accompanied me to the waterside,
and at parting promised that they would soon return my visit.

In this walk I had the satisfaction to see that the island had received
some benefit from our former visits. Two shaddocks were brought to me, a
fruit which they had not, till we introduced it. And among the articles
which they brought off to the ship and offered for sale were capsicums,
pumpkins, and two young goats.

On my return to the ship I found that a small disturbance had been
occasioned by one of the natives making an attempt to steal a tin pot;
which, on being known to Oreepyah, he flew into a violent rage, and it
was with some difficulty that the thief escaped with his life. He drove
all his countrymen out of the ship; and when he saw me he desired if at
any time I found a thief that I would order him to be tied up and
punished with a severe flogging.

This forenoon a man came on board with Captain Cook's picture which had
been drawn by Mr. Webber in 1777 and left with Otoo. It was brought to me
to be repaired. The frame was broken but the picture no way damaged
except a little in the background. They called it Toote (which has always
been their manner of pronouncing Captain Cook's name) Earee no Otaheite,
chief of Otaheite. They said Toote had desired Otoo, whenever any English
ship came, to show the picture, and it would be acknowledged as a token
of friendship. The youngest brother of Otoo, named Whydooah, visited me
this afternoon: he appeared stupefied with drinking ava. At sunset all
our male visitors left the ship.

Tuesday 28.

The next morning early I received a message from Otoo to inform me of his
arrival and requesting that I would send a boat for him; which I
immediately did with an officer (Mr. Christian) to conduct him on board.
He came with numerous attendants and expressed much satisfaction at our
meeting. After introducing his wife to me we joined noses, the customary
manner of saluting, and to perpetuate our friendship he desired we should
exchange names. I was surprised to find that instead of Otoo, the name by
which he formerly went, he was now called Tinah. The name of Otoo, with
the title of Earee Rahie, I was informed had devolved to his eldest son
who was yet a minor, as is the custom of the country. The name of Tinah's
wife was Iddeah: with her was a woman dressed with a large quantity of
cloth in the form of a hoop, which was taken off and presented to me with
a large hog and some breadfruit. I then took my visitors into the cabin
and after a short time produced my presents in return. The present I made
to Tinah (by which name I shall hereafter call him) consisted of
hatchets, small adzes, files, gimblets, saws, looking-glasses, red
feathers, and two shirts. To Iddeah I gave earrings, necklaces, and
beads; but she expressed a desire also for iron, and therefore I made the
same assortment for her as I had for the husband. Much conversation took
place among them on the value of the different articles and they appeared
extremely satisfied, so that they determined to spend the day with me and
requested I would show them all over the ship, and particularly the cabin
where I slept. This though I was not fond of doing I indulged them in;
and the consequence was as I had apprehended that they took a fancy to so
many things that they got from me nearly as much more as I had before
given them. Afterwards Tinah desired me to fire some of the great guns:
this I likewise complied with and, as the shot fell into the sea at a
great distance, all the natives expressed their surprise by loud shouts
and acclamations.

I had a large company at dinner; for besides Tinah and his wife there was
Otow, the father of Tinah, Oreepyah, and Whydooah, two of his brothers,
Poeeno, and several other chiefs. Tinah is a very large man, much above
the common stature, being not less than six feet four inches in height
and proportionably stout: his age about thirty-five. His wife (Iddeah) I
judged to be about twenty-four years of age: she is likewise much above
the common size of the women at Otaheite and has a very animated and
intelligent countenance. Whydooah, the younger brother of Tinah, was
highly spoken of as a warrior but had the character of being the greatest
drunkard in the country; and indeed to judge from the withered appearance
of his skin he must have used the pernicious drink called ava to great
excess. Tinah was fed by one of his attendants who sat by him for that
purpose, this being a particular custom among some of the superior
chiefs; and I must do him the justice to say he kept his attendant
constantly employed: there was indeed little reason to complain of want
of appetite in any of my guests. As the women are not allowed to eat in
presence of the men Iddeah dined with some of her companions about an
hour afterwards in private, except that her husband Tinah favoured them
with his company and seemed to have entirely forgotten that he had
already dined.

Provisions were brought off to the ship in the greatest plenty and, to
prevent as much as possible anything which might occasion disputes, I
desired Mr. Peckover, the gunner, to undertake the management of our
traffic with the natives. Some of the hogs brought today weighed 200
pounds and we purchased several for salting. Goats were likewise brought
off for sale, and I bought a she-goat and kid for less than would have
purchased a small hog. Our friends here expressed much disappointment
that there was no portrait-painter on board; Tinah in particular, who
wished to have had pictures of his father and family.

An intimacy between the natives and our people was already so general
that there was scarce a man in the ship who had not his tyo or friend.
Tinah continued with me the whole afternoon, in the course of which he
ate four times of roast pork besides his dinner. When he left the ship he
requested I would keep for him all the presents I had given to him as he
had not at Matavai a place sufficiently safe to secure them from being
stolen; I therefore showed him a locker in my cabin for his use and gave
him a key to it. This is perhaps not so much a proof of his want of power
as of the estimation in which they hold European commodities and which
makes more than the common means of security requisite to prevent theft.

I had sent Nelson and his assistant to look for plants, and it was no
small pleasure to me to find by their report that according to
appearances the object of my mission would probably be accomplished with
ease. I had given directions to everyone on board not to make known to
the islanders the purpose of our coming lest it might enhance the value
of the breadfruit plants, or occasion other difficulties. Perhaps so much
caution was not necessary but at all events I wished to reserve to myself
the time and manner of communication. Nelson met with two fine
shaddock-trees which he had planted in 1777: they were full of fruit but
not ripe.

Wednesday 29.

In the morning I returned Tinah's visit for I found he expected it. He
was in a small shed about a quarter of a mile to the eastward of Matavai
point with his wife and three children, not their own but who they said
were relations. In my walk I had picked up a numerous attendance for
everyone I met followed me; so that I had collected such a crowd that the
heat was scarce bearable, everyone endeavouring to get a look to satisfy
their curiosity: they however carefully avoided pressing against me, and
welcomed me with cheerful countenances and great good nature.

I made Tinah understand that my visit was particularly to him, and gave
him a second present, equal to the first, which he received with great
pleasure; and to the people of consequence that were about him I also
presented some article or other. There were great numbers of children
and, as I took notice of the little ones that were in arms and gave them
beads, both small and great, but with much drollery and good humour,
endeavoured to benefit by the occasion. Boys of ten and twelve years old
were caught up in arms and brought to me, which created much laughter; so
that in a short time I got rid of all I had brought on shore.

In my return I called on Poeeno, and an elderly chief, a relation of his,
called Moannah, the principal men of this district and with whom I judged
it my interest to be on good terms. I gave them several valuable articles
and, as the situation here was eligible for a garden, I planted melon,
cucumber, and salad-seeds. I told them many other things should be sown
for their use; and they appeared much pleased when they understood I
intended to plant such things as would grow to be trees and produce
fruit. I saw large patches of tobacco growing without culture and many
pumpkin vines. The breadfruit trees and coconut trees at this time were
full of fruit.

I went on board to dinner and Moannah accompanied me. In the afternoon I
returned to Poeeno's with some additional seeds to improve the little
garden I had begun to make in the forenoon. While I was giving directions
I received a message from Tinah inviting me to come to him at his brother
Oreepyah's house, which was near the beach. At this place I found a great
number of people collected who, on my appearance, immediately made way
for me to sit down by Tinah. The crowd being ordered to draw back, a
piece of cloth about two yards wide and forty-one yards in length was
spread on the ground; and another piece of cloth was brought by Oreepyah,
which he put over my shoulders and round my waist in the manner the
chiefs are clothed. Two large hogs, weighing each above two hundred
pounds, and a quantity of baked breadfruit and coconuts were then laid
before me as a present, and I was desired to walk from one end of the
cloth spread on the ground to the other, in the course of which Tyo and
Ehoah* were repeated with loud acclamations. This ceremony being ended
Tinah desired I would send the things on board, which completely loaded
the boat; we therefore waited till she came back and then I took them on
board with me; for I knew they expected some return. The present which I
made on this occasion was equal to any that I had made before; but I
discovered that Tinah was not the sole proprietor of what he had given to
me for the present I gave was divided among those who, I guessed, had
contributed to support his dignity; among whom were Moannah, Poeenah, and
Oreepyah; Tinah however kept the greatest part of what I had given and
everyone seemed satisfied with the proportion he allotted them.

(*Footnote. Tyo and Ehoah are words of the same signification, i.e.
friend.)

The Otaheite breed of hogs seems to be supplanted by the European.
Originally they were of the China sort, short and very thick-necked; but
the superior size of the European have made them encourage our breed.

Thursday 30.

At break of day Tinah and his wife came again to the ship and, as their
attendants were numerous, I provided a breakfast for them of broiled and
roasted pork, which they preferred to tea. Our arrival being known all
over the island, we had this day a great number of strangers on board who
came from the most remote parts, and in the forenoon some hooks and
thimbles were cut out from the blocks. This induced me to order all the
natives out of the ship except the chiefs and their attendants. In
executing these orders a daring fellow attacked the sentinel but escaped
among the crowd. Everyone knew the consequence of offending the sentinel
and were exceedingly alarmed at the appearance of anger I thought
necessary to assume.

Among those who visited us today were two chiefs of great consequence,
Marremarre and his son Poohaitaiah Otee, Earees of the districts of
Itteeah and Attahooroo. Otee was fed at dinner in the same manner as
Tinah. It was evident that the attention which I showed to these chiefs
seemed to give uneasiness to Tinah. At sunset my visitors took leave and
were carried on shore by one of the ship's boats, which has always been
regarded as a mark of distinction, and on that account preferred by them
to going in their own canoes. At their request a race was rowed between
our five-oared cutter and one of their double canoes with four paddles.
Great exertions were used on both sides but the cutter first reached the
shore. In their return to the ship Oreepyah stopped them till a large
piece of cloth that he had sent for was brought; which he tied to the
boat-hook and desired should be carried off as a trophy of their victory.

Friday 31.

The next morning at sunrise Moannah came on board with a message from
Tinah to acquaint me that he was mattow (afraid to see me) till he had
recovered some things that had been stolen from the ship and which he had
sent after. I knew there was something wrong, as no canoes came off to us
and, on looking about, we found the buoy of the best bower anchor had
been taken away, I imagine for the sake of some iron hoops that were on
it. That this might not create any coolness I sent a boat to Tinah to
invite him and his friends to come on board; which they immediately did
and were no longer under any apprehensions. I had made an appointment
with Oreepyah for him to go with me to Oparre this morning; but the
accident just mentioned caused him to break his engagement, he having
gone, I was informed, in search of what had been stolen.

Oparre is the district next to the westward of Matavai. One of my reasons
for going to Oparre was to see if Nelson would be able to procure plants
there; but I gave the credit of my visit to young Otoo, the son of Tinah,
who was the Earee Rahie, and lived with the rest of Tinah's children at
Oparre. I prepared a magnificent present for this youth, who was
represented to me as the person of the greatest consequence, or rather of
the highest rank, in the island. At noon I left the ship, accompanied by
Tinah, his wife Iddeah, and Poeeno. Moannah was to have been of the party
but he insisted on remaining in the ship to prevent his countrymen from
attempting to steal anything.

After half an hour's sailing we arrived at Oparre. During this time Tinah
gave me a more circumstantial account of the cattle and sheep that had
been left with him: he related that, after five years from the time of
Captain Cook's departure (counting 63 moons) the people of the Island
Eimeo joined with those of Attahooroo, a district of Otaheite, and made a
descent on Oparre: that after some resistance by which many men were
killed Tinah and his people fled to the mountains, leaving all their
property to the mercy of the victorious party who destroyed almost
everything which they found not convenient to take away with them. Some
of the cattle were killed and eaten but the greater part were taken to
Eimeo. The cows he said had produced eight calves and the ewes ten young
ones. The ducks, among which they classed the geese, had greatly
increased; but the turkeys and peacocks, whatever was the cause, had not
bred. It seemed to give Tinah great pleasure to observe how much I was
concerned for the destruction of so many useful animals; but the cause of
his satisfaction, I found, did not proceed from any expectation that I
should replace them, but from the belief that I would take vengeance on
the people who had deprived him of them; for with respect to the loss of
the cattle he appeared so unconcerned and indifferent that I was very
angry with him. There is however sufficient excuse for his resentment
against the people of Eimeo; for the large extensive houses which we had
seen in this part of Otaheite in the year 1777 were all destroyed, and at
present they had no other habitations than light sheds which might be
taken by the four corners and removed by four men: and of the many large
canoes which they then had not more than three remained. Tinah,
understanding from my conversation that I intended visiting some of the
other islands in this neighbourhood, very earnestly desired I would not
think of leaving Matavai. "Here," said he, "you shall be supplied
plentifully with everything you want. All here are your friends and
friends of King George: if you go to the other islands you will have
everything stolen from you." I replied that, on account of their goodwill
and from a desire to serve him and his country, King George had sent out
those valuable presents to him; "and will not you, Tinah, send something
to King George in return?" "Yes," he said, "I will send him anything I
have;" and then began to enumerate the different articles in his power,
among which he mentioned the breadfruit. This was the exact point to
which I wished to bring the conversation and, seizing an opportunity
which had every appearance of being undesigned and accidental, I told him
the breadfruit trees were what King George would like; upon which he
promised me a great many should be put on board, and seemed much
delighted to find it so easily in his power to send anything that would
be well received by King George.

On landing at Oparre an immense crowd of natives as usual immediately
thronged about us. I enquired for Oreepyah, whom I expected to have met
me here, but he was not yet returned from his search after the thieves;
we therefore went under a shed of his to wait for him, and in about a
quarter of an hour he joined us, bringing with him an iron scraper and
one of the hoops of the buoy. I thanked him for the trouble which he had
taken, and assured him that I was perfectly satisfied, for he still
seemed apprehensive of my displeasure.

We took leave for a short time of Oreepyah and I proceeded with Tinah to
make my visit to the young Otoo, the Earee Rahie. When we had walked
about five minutes Tinah stopped and informed me that no person could be
permitted to see his son, who was covered above the shoulders. He then
took off his upper garments and requested I would do the same. I replied
that I had no objection to go as I would to my own king, who was the
greatest in all the world and, pulling off my hat, he threw a piece of
cloth round my shoulders and we went on. About a quarter of a mile
farther towards the hills, through a delightful shade of breadfruit
trees, we stopped at the side of a small serpentine river: here I was in
view of a house on the other side at about fifty yards distance. From
this house the young king was brought out on a man's shoulders, clothed
in a piece of fine white cloth, and I was desired by Tinah to salute him
by the name of Too Earee Rahie. The present which I had prepared was
divided into three parts, and two other children made their appearance in
the same manner. The first present I gave to a messenger who attended for
that purpose; and I was instructed by Tinah to say that it was for the
Earee Rahie; that I was his friend; that I hated thieves; and that I came
from Britannia. The second present was sent in the same manner, with a
similar message, to one of the other children and likewise the third.

As I could not see the Earee Rahie distinctly I desired to be permitted
to go over the river to him; but this, it seems, could not be complied
with: therefore after seeing the presents delivered I returned with Tinah
towards Oreepyah's house. I was informed that Tinah had four children by
his wife Iddeah. Otoo, or Too, the Earee Rahie, appeared to be about six
years old: the second is a girl named Terrenah Oroah: the third a boy,
Terreetappanooai; and a fourth, an infant girl, whom I did not see, named
Tahamydooah.

When we came to the place where we had first stopped Tinah took the cloth
from my shoulders and desired me to put my hat on; I expressed a desire
to see more of the place and he took me back by a different way. On
passing a trunk of a tree, rudely carved, I was desired again to pull my
hat off, and all uncovered their shoulders. This I discovered to be
nothing more than the boundary of the king's land; on which whoever set
their feet uncovered themselves out of respect.

We stopped at a house belonging to Tinah where I was treated with a
concert of one drum and three flutes with singing by four men. I made
some presents to the performers and we removed to Oreepyah's house where,
after paying my compliments to him, which I found was expected, Tinah
made me a present of a large hog and some coconuts. He then introduced an
uncle of his called Mowworoah, a very old man much tattooed and almost
blind. To this chief I made a present and soon after I embarked with
Tinah, Oreepyah, their wives, and Poeeno. A vast number of people were
collected on the beach to see us depart and as soon as the boat had put
off Tinah desired me to fire my pocket pistol, the poopooe ete ete, as he
called it: the report seemed to electrify the whole crowd but, finding no
harm done, they gave great shouts of approbation.

Nelson, who accompanied me in this expedition, had but little opportunity
to search after plants, the natives having crowded so much about him: he
saw enough however to assure him that they were to be procured here as
plentifully as at Matavai.

In our passage to the ship, which we rowed in one hour, nothing but
Britannie was enquired after and of the number of ships and guns. When I
told them we had ships of 100 guns they could not believe it till I drew
one on paper: they then asked me if it was not as big as Tarrah, which is
a high projecting headland halfway between Matavai and Oparre, called by
us One-tree Hill. Tinah much wished that one of these large ships should
be sent to Otaheite and that myself should come in her, and bring him a
number of things that he wanted; among which he particularly desired beds
and high-backed elbow chairs might not be forgotten: a request perfectly
according with the indolent character of Tinah.

November. Saturday 1.

As we had occasion to fix a tent on Point Venus this morning we moved the
ship nearer to it and moored again in six fathoms, the point bearing
north-north-east.

Tinah and several other chiefs dined on board with me. After dinner I
went on shore with Tinah and made a visit to his father Otow. I likewise
went to the garden which I had made near Poeeno's house and found
everything had been taken care of. After this I was invited to an
entertainment called Heiva, which Tinah had ordered and which consisted
of singing and dancing by three men and a young girl. When this
performance was finished I returned to the ship.

Sunday 2.

At daylight I sent Mr. Christian with a party to erect our tent and soon
after followed myself with Tinah, Moannah, and Poeeno. With their consent
I fixed a boundary, within which the natives were not to enter without
leave and the chiefs cautioned them against it.

The principal use of the tents on shore was for a lodgment for the
plants; and I had now, instead of appearing to receive a favour, brought
the chiefs to believe that I was doing them a kindness in carrying the
plants as a present from them to the Earee Rahie no Britanee. The party
at the tent consisted of nine persons, including Nelson and his
assistant.

Tinah dined with me on board and was today my only visitor: nevertheless
the ceremony of being fed he so scrupulously observed that, even after
all the attendants were sent away and we were left by ourselves, I was
obliged to lift the wine to his mouth. The wives of the Earees are
sometimes subject to this restriction after the birth of a child but are
released after a certain time on performing a ceremony called Oammo.

After dinner Tinah invited me to accompany him with a present of
provisions to a party of the Arreoys, a society described in the accounts
of the former voyages: in this ceremony he made me the principal person.
Our way to the place where the offering was to be made was by the side of
a river along the banks of which I had always walked before this time;
but on the present occasion a canoe was provided for me and dragged by
eight men. On arriving at the landing-place I saw a large quantity of
breadfruit with some hogs ready dressed and a quantity of cloth. At about
forty yards distant sat a man who, I was informed, was a principal
Arreoy. A lane being made by the crowd he was addressed by one of Tinah's
people, standing on the canoe, in a speech composed of short sentences
which lasted about a quarter of an hour. During this a piece of cloth was
produced, one end of which I was desired to hold, and five men, one with
a sucking pig and the others having each a basket of breadfruit, prepared
to follow me. In this order we advanced to the Arreoy and laid the whole
down before him. I then spoke several sentences dictated to me by Tinah,
the meaning of which I did not understand and, my pronunciation not being
very exact, caused a great deal of mirth. This speech being finished I
was shown another Arreoy, who had come from Ulietea, and to him likewise
I was required to deliver an oration. Tinah understanding from me that I
had children in my own country he desired me to make one more offering on
their account. There still remained three baskets of breadfruit, a small
pig, and another piece of cloth: with these, assisted as before, I made
the offering in favour of my children to the man whom I had first
addressed. He made no reply to all my fine speeches but sat with great
gravity and received everything as a matter of right and not of courtesy.

All that I could make out of this strange ceremony was that the Arreoys
are highly respected and that the society is chiefly composed of men
distinguished by their valour or some other merit, and that great trust
and confidence is reposed in them; but I could not comprehend what this
had to do with my children or why it should be imagined that an offering
made on their account to a society of men who destroy all their children
should be propitious. I learnt from Tinah, in talking about his children,
that his first-born child was killed as soon as it came into the world,
he being then an Arreoy; but before his second child was born he quitted
the society. The Arreoys are allowed great latitude in their amours
except in times of danger. Then as they are almost all fighting men (tata
toa) they are restricted that they may not weaken or enervate themselves.

These ceremonies being ended I returned to the ship.

Such of the natives as I conversed with about the institution of so
extraordinary a society as the Arreoy asserted that it was necessary to
prevent an overpopulation. Worrow worrow no te mydidde, worrow worrow te
tata. We have too many children and too many men was their constant
excuse. Yet it does not appear that they are apprehensive of too great an
increase of the lower class of people, none of them being ever admitted
into the Arreoy society. The most remarkable instance related to me of
the barbarity of this institution was of Teppahoo, the Earee of the
district of Tettaha, and his wife, Tetteehowdeeah, who is sister to Otow
and considered as a person of the first consequence. I was told that they
have had eight children, every one of which was destroyed as soon as
born. That any human beings were ever so devoid of natural affection as
not to wish to preserve alive one of so many children is not credible. It
is more reasonable to conclude that the death of these infants was not an
act of choice in the parents; but that they were sacrificed in compliance
with some barbarous superstition with which we are unacquainted. What
strengthens this conjecture is that they have adopted a nephew as their
heir, of whom they are excessively fond.

In countries so limited as the islands in the South Seas, the natives of
which, before they were discovered by European navigators, probably had
not an idea of the existence of other lands, it is not unnatural that an
increasing population should occasion apprehensions of universal
distress. Orders of celibacy which have proved so prejudicial in other
countries might perhaps in this have been beneficial; so far at least as
to have answered their purpose by means not criminal. The number of
inhabitants at Otaheite have been estimated at above one hundred
thousand. The island however is not cultivated to the greatest advantage:
yet were they continually to improve in husbandry their improvement could
not for a length of time keep pace with an unlimited population.

An idea here presents itself which, however fanciful it may appear at
first sight, seems to merit some attention: While we see among these
islands so great a waste of the human species that numbers are born only
to die, and at the same time a large continent so near to them as New
Holland, in which there is so great a waste of land uncultivated and
almost destitute of inhabitants, it naturally occurs how greatly the two
countries might be made to benefit each other, and gives occasion to
regret that the islanders are not instructed in the means of emigrating
to New Holland, which seems as if designed by nature to serve as an
asylum for the superflux of inhabitants in the islands. Such a plan of
emigration, if rendered practicable to them, might not only be the means
of abolishing the horrid custom of destroying children as it would remove
the plea of necessity but might lead to other important purposes. A great
continent would be converted from a desert to a populous country; a
number of our fellow-creatures would be saved; the inhabitants of the
islands would become more civilised; and it is not improbable but that
our colonies in New Holland would derive so much benefit as to more than
repay any trouble of expense that might be incurred in endeavouring to
promote so humane a plan.

The latter however is a remote consideration for the intertropical parts
of New Holland are those most suited to the habits and manner of living
of the islanders; and likewise the soil and climate are the best adapted
to their modes of agriculture. Man placed by his Creator in the warm
climates perhaps would never emigrate into the colder unless under the
tyrannous influence of necessity; and ages might elapse before the new
inhabitants would spread to our settlers though they are but barely
within the limits of frost, that great cause of nine-tenths of the
necessities of Europeans. Nevertheless besides forwarding the purposes of
humanity and general convenience in bringing a people without land to a
land without people the benefit of a mutual intercourse with a
neighbouring and friendly colony would in itself be no inconsiderable
advantage.

Among people so free from ostentation as the Otaheiteans, and whose
manners are so simple and natural, the strictness with which the
punctilios of rank are observed is surprising. I know not if any action,
however meritorious, can elevate a man above the class in which he was
born unless he were to acquire sufficient power to confer dignity on
himself. If any woman of the inferior classes has a child by an Earee it
is not suffered to live. Perhaps the offspring of Teppahoo and
Tetteehowdeeah were destined to satisfy some cruel adjustment of rank and
precedency.


CHAPTER 7.

A theft committed.
Deception of the painted Head.
Conversation with a Priest.
A Wrestling Match.
Reports of the Natives concerning other Islands.
Some Account of Omai.

1788. November. Monday 3.

The trade for provisions I directed to be carried on at the tent by Mr.
Peckover the gunner. Moannah likewise resided there as a guard over his
countrymen; but though it appeared to be the wish of all the chiefs that
we should remain unmolested it was not possible entirely to prevent them
from pilfering.

My table at dinner was generally crowded. Tinah, Oreepyah, Poeeno, and
Moannah, were my regular guests and I was seldom without some chiefs from
other districts. Almost every individual of any consequence has several
names which makes it frequently perplexing when the same person is spoken
of to know who is meant. Every chief has perhaps a dozen or more names in
the course of thirty years; so that the person who has been spoken of by
one visitor will not perhaps be known to another unless other
circumstances lead to a discovery. The father of Tinah, at this time
called Otow, was known in 1769 by the name of Whappai.

I showed Tinah the preparations I was making to take on board the
breadfruit plants which pleased him exceedingly, but he did not forget to
remind me that when the next ship came out he hoped King George would
send him large axes, files, saws, cloth of all kinds, hats, chairs, and
bedsteads, with arms, ammunition, and in short everything he could think
of mentioning.

This afternoon the gudgeon of the rudder belonging to the large cutter
was drawn out and stolen without being perceived by the man that was
stationed to take care of her. Several petty thefts having been committed
by the natives, mostly owing to the negligence of our own people and, as
these kind of accidents generally created alarm and had a tendency to
interrupt the good terms on which we were with the chiefs, I thought it
would have a good effect to punish the boat-keeper in their presence,
many of them happening to be then on board; and accordingly I ordered him
a dozen lashes. Tinah with several of the chiefs attended the punishment
and interceded very earnestly to get it mitigated: the women showed great
sympathy and that degree of feeling which characterises the amiable part
of their sex.

The natives brought off today two different kinds of roots that grow like
yams: one they call Ettee, which is a sweet root, common also to the
Friendly Islands, and may be eaten as a sweetmeat: the other they call
Appay, a root like the Tyah or Eddie in the West Indies. A fruit called
Ayyah, which is the jambo of Batavia, was likewise brought off to us:
they are as large as middle-sized apples, very juicy and refreshing, and
may be eaten in large quantities. Also some Avees, which are the real
Otaheite apple; but they were not yet in season. These are a delicious
high-flavoured fruit and before they are ripe answer the culinary
purposes of our apples.

Tuesday 4.

A chief called Tootaha, who came from the island Ulietea, was introduced
to me today by Tinah as one of his particular friends. I was told that he
was a priest and a person of great knowledge. I desired Tinah to take
what he thought proper as a present for him; and I must do Tinah the
justice to say he was more sparing than I should have been. I likewise
received a visit today from Oedidee, the man who had been at sea with
Captain Cook in 1773 and 1774, as related in the account of that voyage.
He still retained some of the English words which he had learnt in that
expedition.

Wednesday 5.

The weather variable with lightning and frequent showers of rain. Wind
east-north-east.

This was the first day of our beginning to take up plants: we had much
pleasure in collecting them for the natives offered their assistance and
perfectly understood the method of taking them up and pruning them.

The crowd of natives was not so great as hitherto it had been: the
curiosity of strangers was satisfied and, as the weather began to be
unsettled and rainy, they had almost all returned to their homes so that
only the people of Matavai and Oparre remained with us, except a few
chiefs from other islands: our supplies however were abundant and what I
considered as no small addition to our comforts, we ceased to be
incommoded when on shore by the natives following us, and could take our
walks almost unnoticed. In any house that we wished to enter we always
experienced a kind reception and without officiousness. The Otaheiteans
have the most perfect easiness of manners, equally free from forwardness
and formality. When they offer refreshments if they are not accepted they
do not think of offering them the second time; for they have not the
least idea of that ceremonious kind of refusal which expects a second
invitation. In like manner at taking leave we were never troubled with
solicitations to prolong our visit, but went without ceremony except
making use of a farewell expression at parting. Another advantage, seldom
found in warm countries, was, in this part of Otaheite being free from
mosquitoes, though at particular times of the year the inhabitants are
pestered with great numbers of flies.

Moannah continued our constant friend at the tent and with Tinah and all
his friends dined with me every day.

The ship's barber had brought with him from London a painted head such as
the hair-dressers have in their shops to show the different fashions of
dressing hair; and it being made with regular features and well-coloured,
I desired him to dress it, which he did with much neatness, and with a
stick and a quantity of cloth he formed a body. It was then reported to
the natives that we had an Englishwoman on board and the quarter-deck was
cleared of the crowd that she might make her appearance. Being handed up
the ladder and carried to the after-part of the deck there was a general
shout of "Huaheine no Brittane myty." Huaheine signifies woman and myty
good. Many of them thought it was living and asked if it was my wife. One
old woman ran with presents of cloth and breadfruit and laid them at her
feet; at last they found out the cheat; but continued all delighted with
it, except the old lady who felt herself mortified and took back her
presents for which she was laughed at exceedingly. Tinah and all the
chiefs enjoyed the joke and, after making many enquiries about the
British women, they strictly enjoined me when I came again to bring a
ship full of them.

Some very fine sugarcane was brought to me; each of the pieces was six
inches round. I had before told Tinah that our sugar was made of it and
he was very desirous to discover the means; for they were so fond of our
loaf sugar that a present to any chief would have been incomplete without
a piece of it. Another article in great estimation and likewise expected
to make part of a present was scissors, which they made use of to keep
their beards in order.

By this time Nelson had, with assistance from the ship, completed a large
garden near the tents in which were sown seeds of different kinds that we
had collected at the Cape of Good Hope. I likewise distributed
fruit-stones and almonds for planting among the chiefs, who I hope will
endeavour to make them succeed and, as they are very fond of
sweet-smelling flowers with which the women delight to ornament
themselves, I gave them some rose-seed.

Thursday 6.

We had very variable weather, much rain, and some westerly winds; so that
a considerable swell ran into the bay and a number of spotted white and
black porpoises made their appearance.

I had the mortification to see that our garden-ground had been much trod
over; and what was worse the chiefs appeared but little concerned at it.
To this kind of carelessness and indifference I attribute the miscarriage
of many of the plants left here by Captain Cook. I had now in a
flourishing state two orange plants, some vines, a fig-tree, and two
pineapple plants, which I gave to Poeeno whose residence is a place
favourable for their growth.

We got on successfully with our plants, having a hundred potted at the
tent and in a fair way of doing well. The cabin also was completed and
ready to receive them on board.

I have before remarked that my friend Tinah was rather of a selfish
disposition and this afternoon he showed a stronger instance of it than I
was witness to at any time before or after. His brother Oreepyah sent on
board to me a present of a large hog and a quantity of breadfruit: but
these kind of presents are much more expensive than purchasing at the
market. Soon after Oreepyah himself came on board. Tinah was with me at
the time and whispered me to tell Oreepyah not to bring any more hogs or
fruit and to take those back which he had sent. This advice as may be
supposed did not produce the effect intended. Oreepyah appears to be a
man of great spirit, and is highly respected by his countrymen. Among
other visitors today was one of the men who had been to Lima in 1776.

Saturday 8.

Our plants had now increased to 252: as they were all kept on shore at
the tent I augmented the guard there, though from the general conduct of
the natives there did not appear the least occasion for so much caution.

While I was at dinner Tinah desired I would permit a man to come down
into the cabin whom he called his Taowah or priest; for I was obliged to
keep a sentinel at the hatchway to prevent being incommoded at my meals
with too much company; a restriction which pleased the chiefs who always
asked leave for any particular person to be admitted of whom they wished
me to take notice. The company of the priest brought on a religious
conversation. He said their great God was called Oro; and that they had
many others of less consequence. He asked me if I had a God? if he had a
son? and who was his wife? I told them he had a son but no wife. Who was
his father and mother? was the next question. I said he never had father
or mother; at this they laughed exceedingly. You have a God then who
never had a father or mother and has a child without a wife! Many other
questions were asked which my little knowledge of the language did not
enable me to answer.

The weather was now fine again and a great number of people were come
from other parts of the island. Tinah informed me that there was to be a
heiva and a wrestling-match on shore, and that the performers waited for
our attendance; we therefore set off with several of our friends and,
about a quarter of a mile from the tents, we found a great concourse of
people formed into a ring. As soon as we were seated a dancing heiva
began, which was performed by two girls and four men: this lasted half an
hour and consisted of wanton gestures and motions such as have been
described in the account of former voyages. When the dance ended Tinah
ordered a long piece of cloth to be brought; his wife Iddeah and myself
were desired to hold the two first corners and, the remaining part being
supported by many others, we carried it to the performers and gave it
them. Several other chiefs made a like present or payment. The performers
were strollers that travelled about the country as in Europe.

After this the wrestling began and the place soon became a scene of riot
and confusion. A party of the Arreoys also began to exercise a privilege,
which it seems they are allowed, of taking from the women such of their
clothes as they thought worth it; so that some of them were left little
better than naked. One young woman who was attacked opposed them with all
her strength and held fast her cloth, though they almost dragged her
along the ground. Observing that I took notice of her she held out her
hand and begged my assistance; and at my request she escaped being
pillaged.

Soon after a ring was again made but the wrestlers were so numerous
within it that it was impossible to restore order. In the challenges they
lay one hand upon their breast and, on the bending of the arm at the
elbow, with the other hand they strike a very smart blow which, as the
hand is kept hollow, creates a sound that may be heard at a considerable
distance; and this they do so frequently and with such force that the
flesh becomes exceedingly bruised and, the skin breaking, bleeds
considerably. At this time the sound from so many resembled that of a
number of people in a wood felling trees. This is the general challenge;
but when any two combatants agree to a trial they present their hands
forward, joining them only by the extremities of the fingers. They begin
by watching to take an advantage; at length they close, seize each other
by the hair and are most commonly parted before either receives a fall.
Only one couple performed anything like the part of good wrestlers; and
as they were an equal match this conflict lasted longer than any of the
others; but they also were parted.

Iddeah was the general umpire and she managed with so much address as to
prevent any quarrelling, and there was no murmuring at her decisions. As
her person was large she was very conspicuous in the circle. Tinah took
no part in the management. Upon the whole this performance gave me a
better opinion of their strength than of their skill or dexterity.

Tuesday 11.

For some time past Tinah had talked of going to the island of Tethuroa
which lies eight or ten leagues north from Otaheite to fetch his mother;
but I found I had only half understood him; for this morning he enquired
when we were to sail there in the ship: however he seemed to feel no
great disappointment at my not complying with his wish. Tethuroa he
informed me is the property of his family. He likewise spoke to me about
an island called Rooopow, the situation of which he described to be to
the eastward of Otaheite four or five days sail, and that there were
large animals upon it with eight legs. The truth of this account he very
strenuously insisted upon and wished me to go thither with him. I was at
a loss to know whether or not Tinah himself gave credit to this whimsical
and fabulous account; for though they have credulity sufficient to
believe anything, however improbable, they are at the same time so much
addicted to that species of wit which we call humbug that it is
frequently difficult to discover whether they are in jest or earnest.
Their ideas of geography are very simple: they believe the world to be a
fixed plane of great extent; and that the sun, moon, and stars are all in
motion round it. I have been frequently asked by them if I have not been
as far as the sun and moon; for they think we are such great travellers
that scarce any undertaking is beyond our ability.

Another island called Tappuhoi, situated likewise to the eastward, was
described to me by Tinah, the inhabitants of which were said to be all
warriors, and that the people of Otaheite did not dare to go there. He
told me that very lately a canoe from Tappuhoi was at the island Maitea;
that as soon as they landed they began to fight with the people of Maitea
who killed them all except a young lad and a woman who have since been at
Otaheite. I saw the boy but could get no information from him. It is most
probable that this unfortunate visit of the canoe from Tappuhoi was not
designed but occasioned by adverse winds which forced them so far from
their own island, and that the people of Maitea began the attack, taking
advantage of their superior numbers, on account of some former quarrel.

Thursday 13.

I had a large company to dine with me today. Some of my constant visitors
had observed that we always drank His Majesty's health as soon as the
cloth was removed; but they were by this time become so fond of wine that
they would frequently remind me of the health in the middle of dinner by
calling out King George Earee no Brittannee; and would banter me if the
glass was not filled to the brim. Nothing could exceed the mirth and
jollity of these people when they met on board.

I was assured by Oediddee and several others that the vines planted at
the island Huaheine by Captain Cook had succeeded and bore fruit; and
that some of the other plants, both at Huaheine and at Oaitepeha, a
district on the south-east part of Otaheite, had been preserved and were
in a thriving state. I was likewise informed that there was a bull and a
cow alive at Otaheite but on different parts of the island, the former at
a place called Itteah, the latter at the district of Tettaha. All the
rest were taken away or destroyed by the people of Eimeo. As Tettaha was
at no great distance I determined to go thither myself the first
opportunity, and make enquiries in hopes that the breed might still be
preserved.

I had much discourse with my guests about Omai: they confirmed to me that
he died about thirty months after Captain Cook left the islands. Soon
after Captain Cook's departure from Huaheine there were some disputes
between the people of that island and those of Ulietea in which also the
natives of Bolabola took a part. Omai, who was become of consequence from
the possessing three or four muskets and some ammunition, was consulted
on the occasion. Such was his opinion and assurances of success that a
war was determined on and took place immediately. Victory soon followed
through the means of those few arms and many of the Ulietea and Bolabola
men were killed. In this contest their flints proved bad, or probably the
locks of the muskets had got out of order: this they remedied by a
lighted stick, one man presenting the musket and another with the burnt
stick setting fire to the priming; without which contrivance their arms
would have proved useless. This expedition it seems consumed all their
ammunition. Peace was soon after established, but I did not understand
that Omai had increased his possessions or his rank. Nevertheless I have
reason to conclude that he was in some degree of favour with his
countrymen from the general good character which they give of him. It
appears that he always remembered England with kindness; for his accounts
to his countrymen have been such as to give them not only a great idea of
our power and consequence but of our friendship and goodwill towards him.

Tyvarooah, the eldest of the New Zealand boys that were left with him,
died a short time after Omai: about Coah, the youngest, I had always
doubtful accounts till I came to Huaheine, where I learnt that he
likewise was dead.

1788. November.

After dinner I went on shore and, while I was at the tents, from having
exposed myself too much in the sun, I was taken ill and continued in much
pain for near an hour. This was soon known among the natives and I was
exceedingly surprised to see Tinah and all the principal people, both men
and women, collecting round me and offering their assistance. For this
short illness I was made ample amends by the pleasure I received from the
attention and appearance of affection in these kind people.

Friday 14.

This morning I had numberless enquiries after my health. The weather
being fine I invited Tinah, Oreepyah, and Poeeno, to accompany me to
Tettaha in order to enquire after the cow; and soon after sunrise we set
off in the launch. Tettaha is nearly four leagues from Point Venus. On
our arrival Tinah sent a man to give notice of our visit. The chief of
the district, whose name was Teppahoo, did not appear, but sent a
messenger to demand if I came only to see the cow or to take it away with
me. In answer to this I sent assurances that I only desired to see it,
and the chiefs who were with me spoke to the same effect. I was then
desired to proceed in the boat farther along shore to the westward. In
our way Tinah made me stop among some fishing canoes to purchase fish for
him, which he eat raw with salt water for sauce. When we arrived at the
landing-place a great number of people had collected, and soon after
Teppahoo arrived. Oreepyah and I went with him about a quarter of a mile,
when I was shown one of the most beautiful heifers I ever saw. I asked if
they had any more but they all said there was no other than a bull at
Itteah, as before mentioned. I could not refrain from expressing my
displeasure at the destruction and the foolish separation of these fine
animals. I had shared with Captain Cook in the trouble of this business
and had been equally anxious for the success.

The district of Tettaha is not so luxuriant and fruitful as the country
about Matavai. As I saw nothing of consequence to detain me I made a
present to Teppahoo and, after inviting him to visit me on board the
ship, which he promised to do, I took leave. Tinah had remained all this
time in the boat. I observed that no respect was shown to him at this
place, nor was he able to procure a coconut or a breadfruit otherwise
than by purchasing it. The heifer being here is a proof of this district
not having been friendly to the people of Matavai and Oparre.

In our way back, having to row against the wind, we stopped to refresh at
Oparre, and it was eight o'clock by the time we arrived at the ship. I
kept my fellow travellers on board to supper and they did not fail to
remind me of the king's health.

Monday 17.

Our collection of breadfruit plants at the tents continued increasing.
This morning I sent twelve on board, in pots, to discover where they
would thrive the best, the air being more temperate on board the ship
than on shore. While I was absent from the ship Teppahoo had been on
board and left a hog as a present for me.

After dinner today Tinah, who was my constant visitor, left the table
sooner than usual. When he was gone Oreepyah, his brother, and Oedidde,
told me a piece of scandal, which had been before hinted to me but which
till now I had not heard of with certainty: this was that Iddeah, Tinah's
wife, kept a gallant, who was a towtow, or servant, and the very person
who always fed Tinah at dinner: and this was so far from being without
Tinah's knowledge or consent that they said it was by his desire. They
added many other circumstances and, as I appeared to doubt, they took
several opportunities in the course of the day of mentioning it to other
people, who all declared it was true.

Tuesday 18.

This afternoon I saw Teppahoo and invited him on board: before we parted
I bargained with him for the heifer which he promised to bring in five
days. My intention was that if I got the heifer I would endeavour to
purchase the bull at Itteah: but if that could not be done then I could
send the heifer as a present to the possessor of the bull, which might
equally well answer my purpose.

It has been mentioned that Tinah had a place in my cabin to keep those
things which I gave him as being more secure on board than on shore. I
had remarked lately that his hoard seemed to diminish the more I
endeavoured to increase it: at length I discovered that Iddeah kept
another hoard in the master's cabin, which she regularly enriched from
her husband's whenever I made him a present, apprehending that I should
cease giving when I saw Tinah's locker full. At his request I set the
carpenters to work to make him a chest large enough for himself and wife
to sleep on. Captain Cook had formerly given him such a chest but it had
been taken from him by the Eimeo people.

Friday 21.

This forenoon I received a message from Teppahoo to acquaint me the
heifer was brought to Matavai. I immediately went on shore and found that
he had been as good as his word. The purchase money was paid, which
consisted of a shirt, a hatchet, a spike nail, a knife, a pair of
scissors, a gimlet, and file; to which was added a small quantity of
loaf-sugar. Teppahoo appeared well pleased with his bargain; and I sent
the heifer to Poeeno's residence near which was plenty of grass.

In the afternoon I was invited to a heiva, the most extraordinary part of
which was an oration, with some ceremonies in compliment to us. Twelve
men were divided into four ranks, with two women in the front; behind
them all stood a priest who made a speech which lasted ten minutes and
which was listened to with some attention. During this the picture of
Captain Cook, which had been brought for that purpose, was placed by my
side. When the priest left off speaking a piece of white cloth was
wrapped round the picture and another piece round me. The priest then
spoke again for a short time, and an old man placed a piece of plaited
coconut leaf at my feet; the same was done to Tinah, and one piece was
put under the picture. After this the dancing began, which was in the
same style that we had already seen.

The head of the ship was the figure of a woman, and not ill carved. As we
were painting the ship's upper works I directed this figure to be painted
in colours, with which the islanders were much pleased. Not only the men
but the women desired me to bring English women when I came again. Today
Oedidde, thinking I was not convinced of the truth of what he had told me
about Iddeah, mentioned the affair to the lady herself in my hearing, at
which she laughed, but said he did ill to tell me of it. However it was
evident she was not much offended for they were both very much diverted
in discoursing upon the subject.

I find it is not at all uncommon for brothers to have connection with the
wives of each other, particularly elder brothers with the wives of their
younger brothers, which is generally allowed and no offence taken: but if
any person not belonging to the family endeavours at the same intimacy it
is resented as an injury. Inclination seems to be the only binding law of
marriage at Otaheite.

As I purposed to get instruments on shore at Point Venus to make
observations I desired Tinah to order a house to be brought there for me,
which was done and fixed in half an hour, being only a light shed
supported by posts.

Monday 24.

Today I bought a turtle that was caught on the reefs. As Tinah was going
to leave me for a few days I had it dressed for his dinner. He told me
that his mother, Oberreeroah, was arrived from the island Tethuroa, and
begged that I would send for her in the morning and take care of her till
he returned, which I willingly promised.

Tuesday 25.

This morning I sent a boat to Oparre, which returned in the afternoon
with Oberreeroah and two women, her servants. As she was old and
corpulent it was with difficulty that we helped her up the ship's side.
As soon as she was in the ship she sat down on the gangway and, clasping
my knees in her arms, expressed her pleasure at seeing me by a flood of
tears. Her servants then produced three pieces of cloth which, with a
large hog, some breadfruit, plantains, and coconuts, she had brought as a
present. As she was fatigued by her journey she wished to remain on board
all night, and I directed accommodations to be prepared, which was done
with little trouble as nothing more was necessary than a mat and some
cloth spread on the deck. She had with her a favourite cat, bred from one
that had been given her by Captain Cook. She told me all the misfortunes
that had befallen her son and friends since Captain Cook left Otaheite.
All the accounts agree in some of the cattle being now alive at the
island Eimeo: in the number they differ but that there were eight is the
least account.

Wednesday 26.

In the morning, Oberreeroah being desirous to go on shore, I made her a
present of several things, which she did not care to take with her then,
but requested that I would keep them safe for her. Only Moannah and
Poeeno dined with me today. They told me that Tinah and his brother
Oreepyah were not on good terms together, and it was imagined that they
would fight as soon as the ship was gone. I had observed a coolness
between them, and had at times endeavoured to make them more cordial, but
with very little effect. Their quarrel has arisen from a disagreement
between their wives.

In the afternoon a canoe from Ulietea arrived in which was an Earee or
chief of that island, who is a nephew to Oberreeroah. He brought a sheep
with him: the poor animal was infected with the mange and in very poor
condition. The climate had not as far as I could judge altered the
quality of the wool, with which he was well covered except a part about
the shoulders. I imagine this animal to be the English ewe left by
Captain Cook. The owner assured me that there were ten sheep at Huaheine;
the truth of which I much doubted. I was surprised and rather mortified
to find that he set so little value on this as to let me have it, at the
first word, for a small adze. I sent it to be kept at Poeeno's with the
heifer.

Friday 28.

Tinah and his wife returned to Matavai and, from appearances which I have
no reason to mistrust, were sincerely glad to see me again after their
short absence. They brought as usual a present of a hog and fruit. This
morning there was an eclipse of the sun, but the weather was so cloudy
that I had only an opportunity of observing the end of the eclipse, which
was at 19 hours 43 minutes 53 seconds.

Saturday 29.

I sent a man to shear the ewe, by which a remedy could more easily be
applied to cure the disease with which it was infected. The garden made
near the tents was not in a prosperous condition: most of the melons and
cucumbers were destroyed by insects; and the soil being sandy was not
favourable to the other seeds. I therefore chose another spot of ground
farther from the seaside and had an assortment of seeds sown.

December. Monday 1.

In the night the rudder of one of the boats was stolen from the tents. On
landing in the morning neither Tinah nor any of his family came near me,
being, I was informed, afraid of my displeasure. As the loss was not
great I immediately sent to assure them that I had no anger except
against the person who committed the theft. In consequence of this
message Tinah and some of the other chiefs came to the tents and promised
that they would exert themselves to discover the thief and get the rudder
restored. This was the first theft of any consequence that had been
committed since the tents were on shore, and my suspicions fell chiefly
on the people who were here from some of the other islands. Tinah had
just begun to build a house for himself and I promised that our
carpenters should assist him. Whydooah, the youngest brother of Tinah,
had lately been one of my constant visitors and seemed to have left off
his former custom of getting drunk with the Ava. He was esteemed one of
their best warriors; and I was told that in the quarrel with the people
of Eimeo he killed Maheine the chief of that island.

Friday 5.

The weather for some time past had been very unsettled. This afternoon
the wind blew fresh from the north-west, which occasioned the sea to
break very high across the Dolphin bank; and in the night such a heavy
broken sea came into the bay that we were obliged to batten all the
hatchways down, and to keep everybody upon deck all night though the rain
came down in torrents. The ship rolled in a most violent manner.

Saturday 6.

In the morning the wind increasing and, there being no possibility of
putting to sea, we struck yards and topmasts and trusted to our anchors.
The river swelled so much with the rain that the point of land on which
the tents stood became an island; and to preserve the breadfruit plants
from being endangered the people were obliged to cut a passage for the
river through a part of the beach at a distance from the tents. The sea
broke very high on the beach; nevertheless a canoe put off and to my
surprise Tinah, his wife, and Moannah made their way good through the
surf and came on board to see me. There was no other person in the canoe
for the weather did not admit of useless passengers: each of them had a
paddle which they managed with great activity and skill. These kind
people embraced me with many tears and expressed their apprehensions for
the safety of the ship. Towards noon however the sea abated considerably,
but the wind continued to blow strong from the north-west. At sunset
Iddeah went on shore but Tinah would remain with me the whole night.

Sunday 7.

The wind continued between the north and north-west but had so much
moderated that I no longer considered our situation to be alarming. At
noon Iddeah returned to the ship with a large hog and a supply of
breadfruit and coconuts; and soon after she and Tinah left the ship,
having exacted a promise from me that if the weather was moderate I would
go on shore in the morning and visit their parents and sister who, they
told me, had been much alarmed on our account. I received a visit
likewise from Poeeno and his wife. This woman had always shown great
regard for us; and now, on our meeting, before I could be aware of it,
she began beating her head violently with a shark's tooth so that her
face was covered with blood in an instant. I put a stop to this as soon
as I could, and with the drying up of the blood her agitation subsided.
This ceremony is frequently performed upon occasions either of joy or
grief. Her husband said that if any accident happened to the ship I
should live with him and that they would cut down trees and build me
another ship.

From this sample of the weather and the information of the natives I was
convinced it would not be safe to continue in Matavai Bay much longer;
and I determined to get everything ready for sailing as speedily as I
could.

Monday 8.

The night proved moderate and in the morning I went on shore where I was
received by Oberreeroah, and several other friends with great affection.

The plants received no injury from the bad weather having been carefully
covered from the spray of the sea: some were in a dormant state and
others were striking out young shoots. Nelson thought that it was better
to refrain a few days from taking them on board; I therefore consented to
defer it. He was of opinion that the plants could be propagated from the
roots only, and I directed some boxes to be filled as we could stow them
where no others could be placed.

Tuesday 9.

This afternoon, in hauling the launch on shore to be repaired, many of
the natives assisting, one of them, a fine boy about ten years old, was
thrown down and a roller which was placed under the boat went over him.
The surgeon being ill I sent off for his assistant. Fortunately no limb
was broken nor did he receive any material injury. The surgeon had been a
long time ill, the effect of intemperance and indolence. He had latterly
scarce ever stirred out of his cabin but was not apprehended to be in a
dangerous state; nevertheless this evening he appeared to be so much
worse than usual that it was thought necessary to remove him to some
place where he could have more air; but to no effect for he died in an
hour afterwards. This unfortunate man drank very hard and was so averse
to exercise that he never would be prevailed on to take half a dozen
turns upon deck at a time in the course of the voyage.

Wednesday 10.

As I wished to bury the surgeon on shore I mentioned it to Tinah, who
said there would be no objection but that it would be necessary to ask
his father's consent first; which he undertook to do and immediately left
me for that purpose. By this circumstance it appears that, though the
eldest son of an Earee succeeds to the title and honours of the father as
soon as he is born, yet a considerable portion of authority remains with
the father even after the son is of age. When Tinah returned I went with
him to the spot intended for the burial place, taking with us two men to
dig the grave; but on our arrival I found the natives had already begun
it. Tinah asked me if they were doing right? "There," says he, "the sun
rises and there it sets." The idea that the grave should be east and west
I imagine they learnt from the Spaniards, as the captain of one of their
ships was buried at Oeitepeha in 1774. Certain it is they had not the
information from anybody belonging to our ship; for I believe we should
not have thought of it. The grave however was marked out very exactly. At
four in the afternoon the body was interred: the chiefs and many of the
natives came to see the ceremony and showed great attention during the
service. Some of the chiefs were very inquisitive about what was to be
done with the surgeon's cabin on account of apparitions. They said when a
man died in Otaheite and was carried to the Tupapow that as soon as night
came he was surrounded by spirits, and if any person went there by
himself they would devour him: therefore they said that not less than two
people together should go into the surgeon's cabin for some time. I did
not endeavour to dissuade them from this belief otherwise than by
laughing and letting them know that we had no such apprehensions.

In the afternoon the effects of the deceased were disposed of and I
appointed Mr. Thomas Denman Ledward the surgeon's mate to do duty as
surgeon.

Friday 12.

I went in a boat to examine the harbours about Oparre and found two
formed by the reefs. The westernmost is the most convenient for sailing
in or out but is not well sheltered from a north-west wind or sea. This
harbour is called by the natives Taowne: it is about a league and a half
distant from Point Venus and may be known by a remarkable mountain,
called by the natives Wawry, which bears south-south-east from the
entrance.

The easternmost harbour is called Toahroah. It is small but as secure as
a reef harbour can well be. It is about three miles distant from Point
Venus. The chief objection to this harbour is the difficulty of getting
out with the common tradewind, the entrance being on the east side, not
more than one hundred yards wide and the depth without inconvenient for
warping. On the south side of the entrance is a Morai: the reef side is
to be kept on board and a lookout to be kept from aloft, whence the shoal
water is better discerned than from the deck.

Sunday 14.

This forenoon we performed divine service. Many of the principal natives
attended and behaved with great decency. Some of the women at one time
betrayed an inclination to laugh at our general responses; but on my
looking at them they appeared much ashamed. After the service I was asked
if no offering was to be made for the Eatua to eat.

The weather had been fair all the last week and at this time appeared
quite settled, so that I was under no apprehensions of danger from
continuing a little longer in Matavai bay.

1788. December. Wednesday 17.

This morning I took a walk into the country accompanied by Nelson and my
old friend Moannah. The breadth of the border of low land before we
arrived at the foot of the hills was near three miles. This part of our
journey was through a delightful country, well covered with breadfruit
and coconut-trees, and strewed with houses in which were swarms of
children. We then proceeded along a valley, still among houses, with
plantations of yams, tarro, the cloth-plant, and their favourite root the
Ava: there were breadfruit trees on the sides of the hills which were
dwarfs in comparison of those on the low land. Our walk was very much
interrupted by a river, the course of which was so serpentine that we had
to cross it several times, being carried over on men's shoulders.

On arriving at a Morai I saw a number of the natives collected and was
informed that the priests were performing their devotions. Sixteen men
were sitting on their heels; in the front was a pole covered with a
plaited coconut branch, and before each of the men there was a number of
small pieces of the same leaf plaited, which they call Hahyree, and each
had likewise a piece round his wrist. One who appeared to be the chief
priest prayed aloud, and was answered by all the rest together: after a
few short sentences and responses they rose and each carried an Hahyree,
which they placed at the foot of the pole and returned to prayer: this
was repeated till all the Hahyree were delivered and then the ceremony
ended. I must not forget to mention that they had placed near the pole an
offering of plantains and breadfruit, which they left for the Eatua. They
very kindly asked us to partake of a roasted hog that had been prepared
for them whilst they were praying; but as I wished to make the most of
the morning before the sun was too high I declined their offer, and
Moannah bespoke refreshments to be ready for us when we returned.

We continued our walk up the valley, which became very narrow, and had
advanced a considerable way beyond all the houses and plantations when we
were suddenly stopped by a cascade that fell into the river from a height
of above 200 feet: the fall at this time was not great but in the heavy
rains must be considerable. The natives look upon this as the most
wonderful sight in the island. The fall of water is the least curious
part; the cliff over which it comes is perpendicular, forming an
appearance as if supported by square pillars of stone, and with a
regularity that is surprising. Underneath is a pool eight or nine feet
deep into which the water falls; and in this place all the natives make a
point of bathing once in their lives, probably from some religious idea.

The hills here approach each other within a few yards and are well
covered with wood. As the road appeared difficult I did not care to
proceed towards the mountain. I cannot with certainty say how far this
curious precipice is from the bay, but think in the road by which we went
it cannot be less than seven miles. It is called Peeah Roah.

In our return we found a young pig prepared for us and we made a hearty
meal. We dined in the house of an old acquaintance of Nelson's for whom
he had in 1777 planted the two shaddock plants formerly mentioned which
he had brought from the Friendly Islands. These we had the satisfaction
to see were grown to fine trees and full of fruit.

In their plantations they do not take much pains except with the Ava and
the Cloth-plant, both of which they are careful to keep clear of weeds.
Many of the plantations of the cloth-plant were fenced with stone and
surrounded with a ditch. The yams and plantains are mostly on the higher
grounds. As soon as we had finished our dinner we returned towards the
ship. I was much delighted in this walk with the number of children that
I saw in every part of the country: they are very handsome and sprightly
and full of antic tricks. They have many diversions that are common with
the boys in England such as flying kites, cats cradle, swinging, dancing
or jumping in a rope, walking upon stilts and wrestling.

Friday 19.

The wind today blew fresh but continued regular from the east and
east-south-east. We had likewise much rain and a long swell set into the
bay. I had not yet determined whether, on leaving Matavai bay, I would go
to the island Eimeo or to the harbour of Toahroah near Oparre: this
uncertainty made Tinah and the rest of my friends very anxious; and they
appeared much distressed on my desiring them this afternoon to send on
board all the things which they wished to have repaired by the forge
without delay, that what they wanted might be done before the ship left
Matavai, which I told them would be in a few days. They very earnestly
entreated I would stay one month longer. I represented this as impossible
and asked Tinah if he would not go with me to Eimeo; but he said that
notwithstanding my protection he was certain the Eimeo people would watch
for an opportunity to kill him. He remained on board with me all night
but his wife went on shore and returned early in the morning, bringing
with her some axes and other things that were in need of repair.

Saturday 20.

When I went on shore I found Otow, Oberree-roah, Moannah, and several
others in great tribulation at the thoughts that we were so soon to leave
them. All the people of Matavai I saw were much concerned at my intention
of going to Eimeo, and took every opportunity to prejudice me against the
people of that island; to which I paid very little attention as their
motive was obvious.

Sunday 21.

Their expressions of friendship and affection for me however I could not
disregard, as I had no doubt of their being genuine and unaffected, and I
felt my unwillingness to leave these kind people so much increased that
the next day I sent the master in the launch to reexamine the depth of
water between this bay and Toahroah harbour. He returned in the evening
and acquainted me that he found a good bottom with not less than sixteen
fathoms depth all the way. The harbour of Toahroah appearing every way
safe I determined to get the ship there as speedily as possible, and I
immediately made my intention public, which occasioned great rejoicing.

Wednesday 24.

This day we took the plants on board, being 774 pots, all in a healthy
state; for whenever any plant had an unfavourable appearance it was
replaced by another. The number of those rejected was 302, of which not
one in ten but was found to be growing at the root.

The natives reckon eight kinds of the breadfruit tree, each of which they
distinguish by a different name. 1. Patteah. 2. Eroroo. 3. Awanna. 4.
Mi-re. 5. Oree. 6. Powerro. 7. Appeere. 8. Rowdeeah. In the first,
fourth, and eighth class the leaf differs from the rest; the fourth is
more sinuated; the eighth has a large broad leaf not at all sinuated. The
difference of the fruit is principally in the first and eighth class. In
the first the fruit is rather larger and more of an oblong form: in the
eighth it is round and not above half the size of the others. I enquired
if plants could be produced from the seed and was told they could not but
that they must be taken from the root. The plants are best collected
after wet weather, at which time the earth balls round the roots and they
are not liable to suffer by being moved.

The most common method of dividing time at Otaheite is by moons; but they
likewise make a division of the year into six parts, each of which is
distinguished by the name of the kind of breadfruit then in season. In
this division they keep a small interval called Tawa in which they do not
use the breadfruit. This is about the end of February when the fruit is
not in perfection; but there is no part of the year in which the trees
are entirely bare.

Thursday 25.

At daylight we unmoored and I sent the tents in the launch to Oparre with
directions that, after landing them, the launch should meet the ship in
the entrance of Toahroah harbour to show the safest part of the channel.
At half-past ten we got the ship under sail and ran down under top-sails:
when we were near the launch it fell calm and the ship shot past her. We
immediately let the anchor go but to our great surprise we found the ship
was aground forwards. She had run on so easy that we had not perceived it
at the time. This accident occasioned us much trouble as we were obliged
to send anchors out astern to get the ship afloat: in doing this one of
the cables swept a rock and was not got clear again without much
difficulty. When the ship was moored Point Venus bore north 46 degrees
east. The east point of the harbour north 65 degrees east one-quarter of
a mile. Our distance from the shore half a cable's length; depth of water
8 1/2 fathoms.

Friday 26.

The next morning on my landing I was welcomed by all the principal
people; I may say by the whole crowd, and congratulated on the safety of
the ship. Tinah showed me a house near the waterside abreast the ship,
which he desired I would make use of and which was large enough for all
our purposes. He and his brother Oreepyah then desired I would stay and
receive a formal address and present which they called Otee. To this I
assented and a stool was brought for me to sit on. They then left me with
Moannah and in a short time I saw Tinah returning with about twenty men
who all made a stop at some distance, and a priest said a short prayer to
the Eatua, to which the rest made reply. A man was then sent to me three
several times, at each time bringing me a small pig and the stem of a
plantain leaf. The first they told me was for the God of Brittannee, the
next for King George, and the last for myself. Moannah then got up and,
without being dictated to, made an oration for me; the purport of which I
understood to be that I received their offering with thanks; that we were
good people and friends; and therefore he exhorted them to commit no
thefts: he told them to bring their pigs, coconuts, and breadfruit, and
they would receive good things in return; that we took nothing without
their consent; and finally that every man was to quit the place (the
house we occupied) at night; for if they made any visit in the dark they
would be killed. With this speech the ceremony ended.

I found this a delightful situation and in every respect convenient. The
ship was perfectly sheltered by the reefs in smooth water and close to a
fine beach without the least surf. A small river with very good water
runs into the sea about the middle of the harbour. I gave directions for
the plants to be landed and the same party to be with them as at Matavai.
Tinah fixed his dwelling close to our station.

Monday 29.

Some of the natives took advantage of the butcher's negligence and stole
his cleaver. I complained of this to the chiefs who were on board and
they promised that they would endeavour to recover it; but an article so
valuable as this was to the natives I had no great expectation of seeing
restored.

The ship continued to be supplied by the natives as usual. Coconuts were
in such plenty that I believe not a pint of water was drunk on board the
ship in the twenty-four hours. Breadfruit began to be scarce though we
purchased without difficulty a sufficient quantity for our consumption:
there was however another harvest approaching which they expected would
be fit for use in five or six weeks. The better kind of plantains also
were become scarce; but a kind which they call vayhee were in great
plenty. This fruit does not hang on the trees like the other kinds but
grows upon an upright stalk of considerable strength and substance.
Though this plantain is inferior in quality to most of the others it
affords great subsistence to the natives. We received almost every day
presents of fish, chiefly dolphin and albacore, and a few small rock
fish. Their fishing is mostly in the night when they make strong lights
on the reefs which attract the fish to them. Sometimes in fine weather
the canoes are out in such numbers that the whole sea appears
illuminated. In the canoes they fish with hook and line and on the reefs
they struck the fish with a spear. Some likewise carry out small nets
which are managed by two men. In the daytime their fishing canoes go
without the reefs, sometimes to a considerable distance, where they fish
with rods and lines and catch bonetas and other fish. Whenever there is a
show of fish a fleet of canoes immediately proceeds to sea. Their hooks
being bright are used without bait in the manner of our artificial flies.
Their rods are made of bamboo; but when there are any very large fish
they make use of an outrigger over the fore part of the canoe, about
twenty-five feet in length, which has two prongs at the extremity, to
each of which is fastened a hook and line; and when a fish takes the hook
it is raised by ropes managed by two men in the stern of the canoe.

January 1789. Thursday 1.

Contrary to my expectation Tinah this afternoon brought on board the
cleaver that had been stolen. The thief had taken it to Attahooroo, and
Tinah told me, which I could easily believe, that it was given up with
reluctance.

Friday 2.

The next morning I offered Tinah a present of axes and other things but,
as he suspected this was meant by way of return for getting the cleaver
restored, he would not be prevailed with to accept a single article.

I had constantly the company of Tinah, his wife, and some of his
relations; but the royal children, though so near us, never came in sight
of the ship. The river separated them from the place occupied by our
people on shore and, for fear of giving alarm or offence, I gave strict
orders that no one should attempt to go near their place of residence.

Monday 5.

At the relief of the watch at four o'clock this morning the small cutter
was missing. I was immediately informed of it and mustered the ship's
company, when it appeared that three men were absent: Charles Churchill,
the ship's corporal and two of the seamen, William Musprat and John
Millward, the latter of whom had been sentinel from twelve to two in the
morning. They had taken with them eight stand of arms and ammunition; but
what their plan was, or which way they had gone, no one on board seemed
to have the least knowledge. I went on shore to the chiefs and soon
received information that the boat was at Matavai; and that the deserters
had departed in a sailing canoe for the island Tethuroa. On this
intelligence I sent the master to Matavai to search for the small cutter,
and one of the chiefs went with him; but before they had got halfway they
met the boat with five of the natives who were bringing her back to the
ship. This service rendered me by the people of Matavai pleased me much
and I rewarded the men accordingly.

I told Tinah and the other chiefs that I expected they would get the
deserters brought back; for that I was determined not to leave Otaheite
without them. They assured me that they would do everything in their
power to have them taken and it was agreed that Oreepyah and Moannah
should depart the next morning for Tethuroa. Oreepyah enquired if they
had pocket pistols "for," said he, "though we may surprise and seize them
before they can make use of their muskets, yet if they have pistols they
may do mischief, even while they are held." I quietened these
apprehensions by assuring them that the deserters had no pistols with
them.

Tuesday 6.

At daylight Oreepyah and Moannah set off in two canoes for Tethuroa, but
the weather became so boisterous that they were obliged to return in the
forenoon, and I was happy to see them get safe in as the sea ran very
high without the harbour. From the first of this month the weather and
winds had been much unsettled with a great deal of rain. Our former
station at Matavai appeared not at all safe, the sea at times breaking
high over the Dolphin bank and making a great swell in the bay. Oreepyah
and Moannah both promised me that they would sail again as soon as the
weather should be fine.

Friday 9.

The wind continued to blow strong at sea though in the harbour we had at
times but light breezes. Poeeno, from Matavai, came to see me today: he
said he was apprehensive that I was displeased with him on account of our
deserters having been carried to Tethuroa by a canoe from Matavai. This
he declared had been done before he heard of it; and that the only
service in his power he had not neglected to do for me, which was the
sending our boat back. As this was really an act of friendship I received
him with great cordiality; and he assured me that there could be no doubt
from the directions Tinah had given of the deserters being brought to the
ship as soon as the weather would admit canoes to go after them.

Saturday 10.

One of the officers this morning on shore inadvertently plucked a branch
from a tree called Tutuee, that bears the oil nut, which was growing at a
Morai. On entering with it into the house occupied by our people all the
natives, both men and women, immediately went away. When I went on shore
I found this branch tied to one of the posts of the house, although the
effect it had on the natives was known. I was much displeased at this
piece of wantonness and ordered the branch to be taken away; but the
natives notwithstanding would not come near the place. They said the
house was taboo, which I understand to signify interdicted, and that none
of them might approach it till the taboo was taken off, which could only
be done by Tinah. To take anything away from a Morai is regarded as a
kind of sacrilege and, they believe, gives great offence to the Eatua. At
my request Tinah took off the taboo, but not before the afternoon. This
was performed by an offering of a plantain leaf at the Morai, and a
prayer made to the Eatua. After this ceremony the house was resorted to
by the natives as usual.

I had not yet given up the hope of obtaining the bull from Itteah, though
I had hitherto received no satisfactory answer to the messages which
Tinah had sent at my desire: I therefore spoke to Poeeno who undertook to
negotiate this business, and I commissioned him to make very liberal
offers. He left me after dinner to return to Matavai. In the evening a
messenger arrived from him to acquaint me that, in his absence, the sheep
which I had trusted to his care had been killed by a dog; and that he had
sent the culprit, hoping that I would kill him for the offence he had
committed. This poor sheep had been so much diseased that I could not
help suspecting he died without the dog's assistance, and that the story
of the dog was invented to prevent my attributing it to want of care.
This doubt did not appear in my answer; as for the dog I told the
messenger to do with him what he pleased.

Tuesday 13.

This morning, the weather being more moderate than it had been for some
days past, Oreepyah sailed with two canoes for Tethuroa.

Wednesday 14.

Some business prevented Moannah from accompanying him but he followed the
next day with two other canoes. The wood that we had got at Matavai being
expended I applied to Tinah, who sent three trees down to the waterside
before night, which when cut up made a good launch load.

I saw two instances of jealousy today one of which had nearly produced
fatal consequences. A man was detected with a married woman by the
husband, who stabbed him in the belly with a knife: fortunately the
intestines escaped and the wound did not prove dangerous. The other
instance was a girl, who had constantly lived with my coxswain, beating
another girl that she discovered to have been too intimate with him.

Friday 16.

In walking today with Tinah near a tupapow I was surprised by a sudden
outcry of grief. As I expressed a desire to see the distressed person
Tinah took me to the place where we found a number of women, one of whom
was the mother of a young female child that lay dead. On seeing us their
mourning not only immediately ceased, but to my astonishment they all
burst into an immoderate fit of laughter, and while we remained appeared
much diverted with our visit. I told Tinah the woman had no sorrow for
her child otherwise her grief would not have so easily subsided; on which
he jocosely told her to cry again: they did not however resume their
mourning in our presence. This strange behaviour would incline us to
think them hardhearted and unfeeling, did we not know that they are fond
parents and in general very affectionate: it is therefore to be ascribed
to their extreme levity of disposition; and it is probable that death
does not appear to them with so many terrors as it does to people of a
more serious cast.

Sunday 18.

I received a message from Poeeno to acquaint me that he had been
successful in his negotiation for the bull, which he had driven part of
the way by land, but could not get farther on account of the rivers and
therefore desired a boat should be sent for him. I accordingly ordered
the launch to be got ready and at two o'clock the next morning Mr. Fryer,
the master, set off in her.

Monday 19.

In the afternoon the launch returned with the bull and my friend Poeeno.
For the night I directed that the bull should remain at Oparre and the
next day he was taken to the cow at Matavai.

Wednesday 21.

Today Poeeno brought to me the person from whom he had the bull to
receive the stipulated payment, which was one of every article of traffic
that I had in my possession. This man, whose name was Oweevee, they told
me was inspired by a divine spirit; and that in all matters of
consequence he was consulted, for that he conversed with the Eatua. It
was, they said, the Eatua that ordered him to demand the bull from Tinah,
which not to have complied with would have been the height of impiety. I
endeavoured to convince them of the roguery of this man, thinking I had a
fair argument to prove it by his selling that which the Eatua had ordered
him to keep; but here I was easily defeated for it seems the Eatua told
him to sell me the beast. This being the case I said I would not give the
animals to any person; that they were now mine and that I would leave
them under the protection of Poeeno and Tinah who I hoped would take care
of them for me till I returned. They both entered into my views and
promised the animals should be attended to, and told me that, while they
were considered as my property, no one would attempt to take them away.

Thursday 22.

This afternoon I received a message from Teppahoo to inform me that our
deserters had passed this harbour and were at Tettaha, about five miles
distant. I ordered the cutter to be got ready, and a little before sunset
left the ship, taking Oedidee with me. By his advice I landed at some
distance from the place where the deserters were but, thinking it
necessary to have the boat within call, and Oedidee assuring me that
there was safe landing farther on, I directed the boat to proceed along
shore whilst Oedidee and I walked along the beach. The night was very
dark and windy and the shore being rocky I soon lost sight of the boat. A
few of the natives had joined us in our walk and from their manner I had
reason to suspect them of a design to close upon us, with an intention no
doubt to plunder: I was provided with pocket-pistols and on producing one
they left us. Oedidee was so much alarmed that I could scarce prevail on
him to proceed. When we arrived at Teppahoo's house we were very kindly
received by him and his wife. The cutter was arrived but there being a
very high surf she could not come within a hundred yards of the shore.

The deserters I was informed were in a house close to us, and I imagined
there would be no great difficulty in securing them with the assistance
of the natives. They had however heard of my arrival; and when I was near
the house they came out without their arms and delivered themselves up. I
sent directions off to the boat for one of my people to come on shore and
for the boat to return to the place where I had landed. My next business
was to secure the arms, which I delivered to Teppahoo to take charge of
for the night. One musket and two bayonets were missing, which they said
were lost by the canoe in which they came from Tethuroa having overset. I
then took leave of Teppahoo who presented us with a plentiful supply of
provisions, and we proceeded with the deserters towards the boat but, as
the wind had increased and it rained hard, I determined to remain on
shore till the morning; and having found shelter for the people we passed
the remainder of the night without accident. At daylight I sent for the
arms and we returned to the ship.

Friday 23.

I learnt from the deserters that at Tethuroa they had seen Oreepyah and
Moannah, who had made an attempt to secure them. They said it was their
intention to have returned to the ship; and it is probable that they were
so much harassed by the natives watching for an opportunity to surprise
them that they might wish to have the merit of returning of their own
accord, to avoid the disgrace of being seized and brought back. At the
time they delivered themselves up to me it was not in their power to have
made resistance, their ammunition having been spoiled by the wet.

In consequence of my having been kept all night from the ship by the
tempestuous weather the timekeeper went down at 10 hours 5 minutes 36
seconds. Its rate previous to this was 1 second, 7 losing in 24 hours,
and its error from the mean time at Greenwich was 7 minutes 29 seconds, 2
too slow. I set it going again by a common watch, corrected by
observations, and endeavoured to make the error the same as if it had not
stopped; but being over cautious made me tedious in setting it in motion,
and increased the error from mean time at Greenwich. The rate of going I
did not find to have altered.

At dinner Tinah congratulated me on having recovered my men, but
expressed some concern that they had not been brought by Oreepyah and
Moannah, lest I should imagine they had not done everything in their
power. To this I replied that I was perfectly satisfied of their good
intentions to serve me, and that I considered myself under great
obligations to them for the trouble they had been at on my account. I
learnt afterwards that they had actually seized and bound the deserters
but had been prevailed upon, by fair promises of their returning
peaceably to the ship, to let them loose: the deserters however, finding
an opportunity to get possession of their arms, again set the natives at
defiance.

Friday 30.

This afternoon I punished one of the seamen, Isaac Martin, with nineteen
lashes for striking an Indian. This was a transgression of so serious a
nature and such a direct violation of my orders that I would on no
account be prevailed on to forgive it, though great intercession was made
by some of the chiefs.

Oreepyah and Moannah were not yet returned from Tethuroa. This place is
resorted to by the principal people of this part of Otaheite at
particular seasons when fish are in great plenty there. It was described
to me to be a group of small keys surrounded by a reef: their produce is
chiefly coconuts and plantains. During the season breadfruit and other
provisions are daily carried over from Otaheite. Not less than a hundred
sail of canoes were at Tethuroa when our deserters were there.

Teppahoo and his wife were become my constant visitors: he had for some
time past been ill, and had made Oparre his place of residence for the
benefit of our surgeon's advice and assistance. At this time he
complained of a hoarseness and sore throat. Mr. Ledward, on examining
him, discovered there had been two holes in the roof of his mouth which,
though healed, had the appearance of having been large: the adjacent
parts appeared sound, yet the surgeon was of opinion that they were
cancerous and would in the end occasion his death.

Saturday 31.

This morning I ordered all the chests to be taken on shore, and the
inside of the ship to be washed with boiling water to kill the
cockroaches. We were constantly obliged to be at great pains to keep the
ship clear of vermin on account of the plants. By the help of traps and
good cats we were freed from rats and mice. When I was at Otaheite with
Captain Cook there were great numbers of rats about all the houses, and
so tame that they flocked round the people at their meals for the offals
which were commonly thrown to them; but at this time we scarce ever saw a
rat which must be attributed to the industry of a breed of cats left here
by European ships.

After breakfast I walked with Tinah to Matavai to see the cattle and the
gardens. Tinah had already taken so large a dose of the Ava that he was
perfectly stupefied. Iddeah however was with us, and she is one of the
most intelligent persons I met with at Otaheite. We went first to
Poeeno's house and saw the bull and cow together in a very fine pasture.
I was informed that the cow had taken the bull; so that if no untoward
accident happens there is a fair chance of the breed being established.
In the garden near Poeeno's house many things had failed. The Indian corn
was in a fine state and I have no doubt but they will cultivate it all
over the country. A fig-tree was in a very thriving way, as were two
vines, a pineapple plant, and some slips of a shaddock-tree. From this
place we walked to the garden at Point Venus, but I had the mortification
to find almost everything there destroyed by the hogs. Some underground
peas and Indian corn had escaped, and likewise the caliloo green and ocra
of Jamaica.

We returned to the ship, and after dinner I was not a little surprised to
hear Tinah seriously propose that he and his wife should go with me to
England. He said he would only take two servants; that he much wished to
see King George who he was sure would be glad to see him. Tinah and many
of his countrymen were become extremely eager to get a knowledge of other
countries, and were continually enquiring about the situations of the
islands which we told them of in these seas. To quiet his importunity I
was obliged to promise that I would ask the king's permission to carry
them to England if I came again; that then I should be in a larger ship
an could have accommodations properly fitted up. I was sorry to find that
Tinah was apprehensive he should be attacked by his enemies as soon as
our ship left Otaheite, and that if they joined they would be too
powerful for him. The illness of Teppahoo, with whom he was on good
terms, gave him much uneasiness, Teppahoo's wife being a sister of Otow's
and aunt to Tinah. They have no children as has been before related, and
if Teppahoo were to die he would be succeeded as Earee of the district of
Tettaha by his brother who is an enemy to Tinah. I have on every occasion
endeavoured to make the principal people believe that we should return
again to Otaheite and that we should revenge any injury done in our
absence to the people of Matavai and Oparre.

The wife of Oedidee is likewise an aunt to Tinah, and sister to Otow. His
native place is Ulietea, where he has some property, but which I imagine
is not of such consequence to him as the countenance of the chiefs with
whom he is connected at Otaheite.

1789. February. Tuesday 3.

I was present this afternoon at a wrestling match where a young man, by
an unlucky fall, put his arm out of joint at the elbow: three stout men
immediately took hold of him and, two of them fixing their feet against
his ribs, replaced it. I had sent for our surgeon but before he arrived
all was well, except a small swelling of the muscles in consequence of
the strain. I enquired what they would have done if the bone had been
broken and, to show me their practice, they got a number of sticks and
placed round a man's arm, which they bound with cord. That they have
considerable skill in surgery is not to be doubted. I have before
mentioned an instance of an amputated arm being perfectly healed and
which had every appearance of having been treated with great propriety.

The part of the beach nearest the ship was become the general place of
resort towards the close of the day. An hour before sunset the
inhabitants began to collect, and here they amused themselves with
exercising the lance, dancing, and various kinds of merriment, till
nearly dark, when they retired to their homes. Of this cheerful scene we
were spectators and partakers every fine evening.

Friday 6.

An occurrence happened today that gave me great concern, not only on
account of the danger with which the ship had been threatened, but as it
tended greatly to diminish the confidence and good understanding which
had hitherto been constantly preserved between us and the natives. The
wind had blown fresh in the night, and at daylight we discovered that the
cable by which the ship rode had been cut near the water's edge in such a
manner that only one strand remained whole. While we were securing the
ship Tinah came on board. I could not but believe he was perfectly
innocent of the transaction; nevertheless I spoke to him in a very
peremptory manner, and insisted upon his discovering and bringing to me
the offender. I was wholly at a loss how to account for this malicious
act. My suspicions fell chiefly, I may say wholly, on the strangers that
came to us from other parts of the island; for we had on every occasion
received such unreserved and unaffected marks of goodwill from the people
of Matavai and Oparre that in my own mind I entirely acquitted them. The
anger which I expressed however created so much alarm that old Otow and
his wife (the father and mother of Tinah) immediately quitted Oparre, and
retired to the mountains in the midst of heavy rain, as did Teppahoo and
his family. Tinah and Iddeah remained and expostulated with me on the
unreasonableness of my anger against them. He said that he would exert
his utmost endeavours to discover the guilty person, but it might
possibly not be in his power to get him delivered up, which would be the
case if he was either of Tiarraboo, Attahooroo, or of the island Eimeo.
That the attempt might have been made as much out of enmity to the people
of Matavai and Oparre as to me, everyone knowing the regard I had for
them, and that I had declared I would protect them against their enemies.
All this I was inclined to believe, but I did not think proper to appear
perfectly satisfied lest Tinah, who was naturally very indolent, should
be remiss in his endeavours to detect the offender. To guard as much as
possible against future attempts of this kind I directed a stage to be
built on the forecastle so that the cables should be more directly under
the eye of the sentinel; and I likewise gave orders that one of the
midshipman should keep watch forward.

In the afternoon Oreepyah returned from Tethuroa. He told me that Moannah
and himself had narrowly escaped being lost in the bad weather and that
Moannah had been obliged to take shelter at Eimeo. Several canoes had
been lost lately in their passage to or from Tethuroa. The oversetting of
their canoes is not the only risk they have to encounter, but is
productive of another danger more dreadful; for at such times many become
a prey to the sharks which are very numerous in these seas. I was
informed likewise that they were sometimes attacked by a fish which by
their description I imagine to be the barracoota, as they attribute to it
the same propensity.

Saturday passed without my seeing anything of Tinah the whole day.

Sunday 8.

The next morning he and Iddeah came to me and assured me that they had
made the strictest enquiries concerning the injury intended us but had
not been able to discover any circumstance which could lead them to
suspect who were concerned in it. This was not at all satisfactory and I
behaved towards them with great coolness, at which they were much
distressed, and Iddeah at length gave vent to her sorrow by tears. I
could no longer keep up the appearance of mistrusting them, but I
earnestly recommended to them, as they valued the King of England's
friendship, that they would exert their utmost endeavours to find out the
offenders, which they faithfully promised. Our reconciliation accordingly
took place and messengers were sent to acquaint Otow and Teppahoo, and to
invite them to return.

It has since occurred to me that this attempt to cut the ship adrift was
most probably the act of some of our own people; whose purpose of
remaining at Otaheite might have been effectually answered without danger
if the ship had been driven on shore. At the time I entertained not the
least thought of this kind, nor did the possibility of it enter into my
ideas, having no suspicion that so general an inclination or so strong an
attachment to these islands could prevail among my people as to induce
them to abandon every prospect of returning to their native country.

A messenger came to me this afternoon from the Earee of Tiarrabou, the
south-east division of Otaheite, with an invitation for me to visit him.
I excused myself on account of the distance and, at Tinah's request, sent
back by the messenger a handsome present which I hope Tinah will get the
credit of. I observed with much satisfaction that a great part of what
Tinah had received from me he had distributed; to some out of friendship
and esteem, and to others from motives of political civility.

Tuesday 10.

Teppahoo and his family left us today to go to Tettaha, where a grand
heiva was to be performed, at which their presence was required.

Wednesday 11.

A small party of heiva people passed through Oparre this morning in their
way to Tettaha, where they were going by appointment. They had the
civility to send me word that if I chose they would stay to perform a
short heiva before me; and I immediately attended. It began by a dance of
two young girls to the music of drums and flutes which lasted no long
time; at the conclusion they suddenly dropped all their dress, which was
left as a present for me, and went off without my seeing them any more.
After this the men danced: their performance was more indecent than any I
had before seen, but was not the less applauded on that account by the
natives, who seemed much delighted.

After this entertainment I went with Tinah and Iddeah to pay a visit to
an old lady named Wanowoora, widow to Towah the late Earee of Tettaha,
who conducted the expedition against Eimeo when Captain Cook was here in
1777. The old lady had just landed and we found her sitting on the beach
by the head of her canoe. With Tinah was a priest and three men, who
carried a young dog, a fowl, and two young plantain boughs: these were
intended for the offering, or present, called Otee. Tinah and his party
seated themselves at about ten yards distance from Wanowoora and were
addressed by her in short sentences for a few minutes, and received her
Otee, which was exactly the same as his. Tinah's priest in return made a
short prayer and his offering was presented to the old lady. Tinah then
rose and went to her, and embraced her in a very affectionate manner; and
she returned his kindness with tears and many expressions which I could
not understand. Soon after he conducted her to a shed and we remained
with her till it was time to go on board to dinner. I invited her to be
of the party but she excused herself on account of age and infirmity.
Tinah gave directions for her and her attendants to be supplied with
whatever they had occasion for, and we went off to the ship.

Friday 13.

This forenoon Tinah sent to inform me that many strangers were arrived
from all parts to be present at a grand heiva which he had prepared in
compliment to me. I accordingly went on shore and found a great crowd of
people collected together. A ring was made at a little distance from our
post, and Tinah and several other chiefs came to meet me. When we were
all seated the heiva began by women dancing; after which a present of
cloth and a tawme or breastplate was laid before me. This ceremony being
over the men began to wrestle and regularity was no longer preserved. Old
Otow came to me and desired I would help to put a stop to the wrestling
as the people came from different districts, some of which were ill
disposed towards others. What Otow had apprehended was not without reason
for in an instant the whole was tumult: every man took to his arms and,
as I found my single interference could be of no service, I retired to
our post and ordered all my people there under arms. At the time the
disturbance began Tinah and Iddeah were absent: their first care was for
me, and Iddeah came to see if I was safe at the post. She had a double
covering of cloth round her and her waist was girded with a large rope. I
desired her to stay under my protection: this she would not consent to
but said she would return as soon as all was over; and away she went.

I immediately gave orders for two guns to be fired from the ship without
shot, which had a good effect: and as no chief was concerned in the
tumult but, on the contrary, all of them exerted their influence to
prevent mischief, everything was soon quiet and Tinah and Iddeah returned
to let me know that all was settled. They went on board with some other
chiefs and dined with me.

After dinner I went on shore with Tinah and his friends, and I found
three large hogs dressed, and a quantity of breadfruit which he had
ordered to be prepared before he went on board, and now desired I would
present them to the different parties that had come to see the
entertainment: one to the chief people of Attahooroo, one to the Arreoys,
and a third to the performers of the heiva. I presented them according to
his directions and they were received with thankfulness and pleasure.
This I looked upon as very handsomely done on the part of Tinah, and I
was glad to see that it was regarded in the same light by his guests.
These instances of liberality make full amends for the little slips which
I have formerly noticed in Tinah. At this time a day seldom passed that
he did not give proofs of his hospitality by entertaining the principal
people that came from different parts of the island to visit him, or to
see the ship. Some of the chiefs he commonly invited to dine on board,
and made provision for others on shore. Scarce any person of consequence
went away without receiving some present from him. This I encouraged and
was glad it was in my power to assist him. But besides the political
motives that I have alluded to it would be unjust to Tinah not to
acknowledge that his disposition seemed improved: he was more open and
unreserved in his manners than formerly, and his hospitality was natural
and without ostentation.

Monday 16.

I was present this afternoon at a wrestling match by women. The manner of
challenging and method of attack was exactly the same as among the men.
The only difference that I could observe was not in favour of the softer
sex; for in these contests they showed less temper and more animosity
than I could have imagined them capable of. The women, I was told, not
only wrestle with each other but sometimes with the men; of this I have
never seen an instance and imagine it can happen but seldom, as the women
in general are small and by no means masculine. Iddeah is said to be very
famous at this exercise.

Tuesday 17.

I walked with Tinah towards the hills to see his country residence which
was at a very neat house, pleasantly situated and surrounded with
plantations. From this place we saw the island Tethuroa. The next morning
I went to Matavai to look after the Indian corn which I judged would be
full ripe for gathering; but on my arrival I found that the natives had
been beforehand with me, the whole being taken away. This I was not at
all sorry for as it shows that they value it too much to neglect
cultivating it.

Monday 23.

Iddeah sent on board for our dinners today a very fine tarro pudding; and
Tinah brought a bunch of bananas that weighed 81 pounds, on which were
286 fine fruit: ten had broken off in the carriage. The tarro pudding is
excellent eating and easily made: I shall describe this piece of cookery
as the knowledge of it may be useful in the West Indies. The tarro being
cleared of the outside skin is grated down, and made up in rolls of about
half a pound each, which they cover neatly with leaves and bake for near
half an hour. An equal quantity of ripe coconut meat is likewise grated,
from which through a strainer the rich milky juice is expressed. This
juice is heated by putting smooth hot stones in the vessel that contains
it, and the tarro is then mixed with it and kept constantly stirring to
prevent burning till it is ready, which is known by the coconut juice
turning to a clear oil.

Wednesday 25.

Iddeah was very uneasy today on account of her youngest child being ill.
She would not accept of assistance from our surgeon but said she had sent
to Tettaha for a man who she expected would come and tell her what to do.
These physical people are called tata rapaow.

Thursday 26.

This morning a man died of a consumption about two miles from our post. I
was informed of it by Mr. Peckover, the gunner, who I had desired to look
out for such a circumstance. I therefore went accompanied by Iddeah in
hopes of seeing the funeral ceremony; but before we arrived the body was
removed to the Toopapow. It lay bare except a piece of cloth round the
loins and another round the neck: the eyes were closed: the hands were
placed, one over the pit of the stomach and the other upon his breast. On
a finger of each hand was a ring made of plaited fibres of the
coconut-tree, with a small bunch of red feathers. Under the Toopapow a
hole was dug, in which at the end of a month the corpse was to be buried.
The deceased was of the lower class; the Toopapow however was neat, and
offerings of coconuts and plaited leaves lay on the ground.

The dead are sometimes brought to the Toopapow in wood coffins, which are
not shaped like ours but are simply a long box. This custom Iddeah
informed me they learnt from the Europeans, and is not very common, as
making plank is a work of great labour.

March. Monday 2.

When I landed this morning I found the inhabitants that lived near to us
had left their houses and retired towards the mountains; and was informed
that in the night a water cask, part of an azimuth compass, and Mr.
Peckover's bedding, had been stolen from the post on shore; the knowledge
of which had caused a general alarm. I sent a message to complain of this
theft to Tinah who did not come near me. About two hours elapsed, during
which time I went on board to breakfast and returned when I saw Tinah and
Oreepyah with a number of people at a house at some distance; and soon
after they all marched to the eastward, passing close by our post.
Oedidee, who was with me, told me that they had intelligence of the
thief, and were gone in quest of him: and in less than an hour news was
brought that they had taken him. Shortly after the whole party appeared
with the water-cask and compass. Tinah had hold of the thief by the arm
and, showing him to me, desired that I would kill him. The bedding, he
said, he had not heard of, but would go in search of it. I applauded him
for the pains he had taken in this business, and explained with some
success the injustice of stealing from us: that if any of our people
committed the least offence against them it did not pass unnoticed; and
that friendship required on their part that those who injured us should
not be protected by them. Tinah stopped me from saying more by embracing
me and the whole crowd cried out Tyo myty (i.e. good friend). Tinah then
left me to enquire after the bedding, and I sent the offender on board,
whom I punished with a severe flogging. I was glad to find this man was
not of Oparre or Matavai.

The fine fruit called Avee was just coming into season: it was likewise
in season at the time of our arrival in October. The breadfruit trees I
have no doubt bear all the year round: we have seen a scarcity of
breadfruit but have never been wholly without it. Some fern-root was
shown to me which in scarce seasons is used by the natives as bread. It
bears a long even-edged leaf about an inch wide; the taste somewhat
resembled that of a yam. I was informed by our people that in their walks
they saw in many places patches of Indian corn just making their
appearance through the ground. This convinces me that the corn taken from
Matavai could not have been better disposed of.

Goats are frequently offered for sale, but I rather discouraged the
buying of them for fear of injuring the breed. The natives will not eat
them, neither will they taste the milk, and ask with some appearance of
disgust why we do not milk the sows? I endeavoured to prevail on Tinah
and Iddeah to eat the goats milk by mixing it with fruit, but they would
only try one spoonful.

We had begun to make preparations for sailing, and Tinah supplied us with
a sufficient stock of wood by ordering trees to be brought down from the
country. He had frequently expressed a wish that I would leave some
firearms and ammunition with him, as he expected to be attacked after the
ship sailed, and perhaps chiefly on account of our partiality to him: I
therefore thought it but reasonable to attend to his request, and I was
the more readily prevailed on as he said his intentions were to act only
on the defensive. This indeed seems most suited to his disposition, which
is neither active nor enterprising. If Tinah had spirit in proportion to
his size and strength he would probably be the greatest warrior in
Otaheite: but courage is not the most conspicuous of his virtues. When I
promised to leave with him a pair of pistols, which they prefer to
muskets, he told me that Iddeah would fight with one and Oedidee with the
other. Iddeah has learnt to load and fire a musket with great dexterity
and Oedidee is an excellent marksman. It is not common for women in this
country to go to war, but Iddeah is a very resolute woman, of a large
make, and has great bodily strength.

Friday 6.

I sent Mr. Fryer the master to sound Taowne harbour. The knowledge that
we intended shortly to sail having spread among the natives a great many
broken iron tools were brought from all parts of the island to be
repaired at our forge; and this morning a messenger arrived from
Waheatua, the Earee of Tiarraboo, with several pieces of Spanish iron
which he desired to have made into small adzes. This request was of
course complied with.


CHAPTER 11.

Arrival of an Arreoy Woman from Tethuroa.
A Present delivered by Tinah for his Majesty.
Other Occurrences to the Time of the Ship's Departure from Otaheite.

1789. March.

From the 5th to the 14th of this month the wind blew constantly from
between the north-west and south-west with a great deal of rain. This was
the longest continuance of westerly winds without interruption that we
experienced. On the 13th several canoes arrived here and at Matavai from
Tethuroa: in these were a large tribe of Arreoys, and among them Huheine
Moyere, the wife of Oreepyah, who is an Arreoy woman, and remained at
Tethuroa after Oreepyah came away. On her arrival a ceremony was
performed called Hooepippee, which seemed to be designed as a public
visit to all their friends, who are collected on the occasion. In this
ceremony there was nothing remarkable: the Arreoy men took their
opportunity to plunder the women who were near them, and Iddeah made a
present of some cloth to Huheine Moyere, and a baked hog to the Arreoys.

Friday 13.

After this ceremony a present was produced from many of the principal
people for young Otoo, the Earee Rahie, which was received by Iddeah,
Tinah being absent. This present consisted of five hogs, and forty-eight
baskets filled with breadfruit, coconuts, tarro, and different kinds of
puddings. The baskets were decorated with slips of cloth, stained with
variety of colours and carried by 24 men, each of whom had a pole on his
shoulder, at each end of which was a basket.

I have seldom spoken of Otoo who was too young to have any share in the
management of affairs, and with whom we were not permitted to have any
intercourse, except speaking to him now and then across a river; at which
times I did not neglect to send the children some little presents, so
that they always rejoiced to see me. I might have been admitted to a
nearer acquaintance if I would have gone with my shoulders uncovered, as
his parents did, but this I declined. The children do not all live under
the same roof, the two sisters eating and sleeping in a separate house,
though at other times they are generally together.

The island Tethuroa may very properly be compared to some of our
watering-places in England, producing a similar effect upon those who
visit it. Many who went there covered with scurf returned plump and fair,
and scarce like the same people. This alteration for the better is in a
great measure to be attributed to the discontinuance of the Ava, which
Tethuroa does not produce: the coconut trees, likewise, which supply them
with their only beverage, growing on low sandy keys and having their
roots below the level of the sea may probably have qualities different
from the coconuts of Otaheite which, with a plenty of fish, that at other
times they are not accustomed to, must no doubt contribute to the
amendment described.

Saturday 14.

I was visited today by a very old man, an uncle to Tupia, the person who
went from these islands in the Endeavour in the year 1769, and who died
at Batavia. He appeared to be near 70 years old and was treated with much
respect by the natives. He made several enquiries concerning his nephew
and requested that when I came again I would bring his hair. At the time
that Tinah mentioned to me his desire of visiting England I asked what
account I could give to his friends if he should not live to return; to
which he replied that I must cut off his hair and carry it to them and
they would be perfectly satisfied.

Monday 16.

On the 16th I was informed that a stop was put to the sale of hogs in the
district of Tettaha. Teppahoo, the Earee of that district, told me that
they had very few hogs left there, and that it was necessary for a
certain time to prohibit every person from killing or selling, that they
might have time to breed. I did not think it reasonable to solicit any
indulgence on this head: my friends at Matavai and Oparre promised to
supply us as long as we remained here, though we had considerably thinned
their stock. After our departure the same restriction was to take place
in these districts, and it being delayed on our account certainly
deserves to be regarded among their acts of friendship towards us.

As it was generally known that we were preparing to sail a number of the
natives from other parts of the island were constantly with us, and petty
thefts were committed whenever the negligence of our people afforded an
opportunity: but no attempt of any consequence was made.

Thursday 19.

This evening Mr. Samwel my clerk returned from an excursion to the
mountains, having been two days absent. He described the hills to be well
clothed with wood, except the tops of the higher mountains which only
produced bushes and fern. The birds he saw were blue parakeets and green
doves, except one which he found burrowing in the ground and brought to
me. This bird was about the size of a pigeon, and proved to be a
white-bellied petrel of the same kind as those seen in high latitudes,
which are called shearwaters. He likewise brought a branch of a plant
like the New Zealand tea-plant, and which at Van Diemen's land we had
made use of for brooms. From the hills he saw the islands Maitea and
Huaheine, which are situated nearly in opposite directions from Otaheite
and are 70 leagues distant from each other.

Friday 27.

For some days past Tinah had been busied in getting two parais, or
mourning-dresses, made, which he intended as a present to King George.
Being finished they were this morning hung up in his house as a public
exhibition, and a long prayer made on the occasion, the substance of
which was that the King of England might forever remain his friend and
not forget him. When he presented the parais for me to take on board he
could not refrain from shedding tears. During the short remainder of our
stay here there appeared among the natives an evident degree of sorrow
that we were so soon to leave them, which they showed by unusual kindness
and attention.

We began this afternoon to remove the plants to the ship. They were in
excellent order: the roots had appeared through the bottom of the pots
and would have shot into the ground if care had not been taken to prevent
it.

The weather was considerably altered for the better and the tradewind
appeared settled. The rainy and bad season of the year may be reckoned to
begin towards the end of November and to continue till near the end of
March. During this time the winds are variable and often westerly, though
we seldom found them to blow strong in that direction. We likewise
experienced frequent intervals of fine weather; but during these months
so open a road as Matavai bay is not a safe anchoring-place for ships
that intend remaining any length of time at Otaheite.

Tuesday 31.

Today all the plants were on board, being in 774 pots, 39 tubs, and 24
boxes. The number of breadfruit plants were 1015, besides which we had
collected a number of other plants. The avee, which is one of the
finest-flavoured fruits in the world. The ayyah, which is a fruit not so
rich but of a fine flavour and very refreshing. The rattah, not much
unlike a chestnut, which grows on a large tree in great quantities: they
are singly in large pods from one to two inches broad, and may be eaten
raw or boiled in the same manner as Windsor beans, and so dressed are
equally good. The oraiah, which is a very superior kind of plantain. All
these I was particularly recommended to collect by my worthy friend, Sir
Joseph Banks. I had also taken on board some plants of the ettow and
matte, with which the natives here make a beautiful red colour; and a
root called peeah, of which they make an excellent pudding.

I now made my last presents to several of my friends with whom I had been
most intimate, particularly to Teppahoo. Several people expressed great
desire to go with us to England. Oedidee, who was always very much
attached to us, said he considered it as his right, having formerly left
his native place to sail with Captain Cook. Scarce any man belonging to
the ship was without a tyo, who brought to him presents, chiefly of
provisions for a sea store.

April. Friday 3.

Tinah and his wife, with his parents, brothers, and sister, dined with me
today and, as I meant to sail early the next morning, they all remained
on board for the night. The ship was crowded the whole day with the
natives, and we were loaded with coconuts, plantains, breadfruit, hogs,
and goats. In the evening there was no dancing or mirth on the beach such
as we had been accustomed to, but all was silent.

Saturday 4.

At daylight we unmoored: the stock of the best bower anchor was so much
eaten by the worms that it broke in stowing the anchor: the small bower
had an iron stock, and in these voyages it is very necessary that ships
should be provided with iron anchor stocks. At half-past six there being
no wind we weighed and, with our boats and two sweeps, towed the ship out
of the harbour. Soon after the sea breeze came, and we stood off towards
the sea.

The outlet of Toahroah harbour being narrow I could permit only a few of
the natives to be on board: many others however attended in canoes till
the breeze came, when I was obliged to leave them. We stood off and on
almost all the remainder of the day. Tinah and Iddeah pressed me very
strongly to anchor in Matavai bay and stay one night longer but, as I had
already taken leave of most of my friends, I thought it better to keep to
my intention of sailing. After dinner I ordered the presents which I had
preserved for Tinah and his wife to be put in one of the ship's boats,
and as I had promised him firearms I gave him two muskets, a pair of
pistols, and a good stock of ammunition. I then represented to them the
necessity of their going away, that the boat might return to the ship
before it was dark, on which they took a most affectionate leave of me
and went into the boat. One of their expressions at parting was "Yourah
no t' Eatua tee eveerah." "May the Eatua protect you, for ever and ever."

All the time we remained at Otaheite the picture of Captain Cook, at the
desire of Tinah, was kept on board the ship. On delivering it to him I
wrote on the back the time of the ship's arrival and departure, with an
account of the number of plants on board.

Tinah had desired that I would salute him at his departure with the great
guns, which I could not comply with for fear of disturbing the plants;
but as a parting token of our regard we manned ship with all hands and
gave him three cheers. At sunset the boat returned and we made sail,
bidding farewell to Otaheite where for twenty-three weeks we had been
treated with the utmost affection and regard, and which seemed to
increase in proportion to our stay. That we were not insensible to their
kindness the events which followed more than sufficiently proves: for to
the friendly and endearing behaviour of these people may be ascribed the
motives for that event which effected the ruin of an expedition that
there was every reason to hope would have been completed in the most
fortunate manner.

To enter into a description of the island or its inhabitants I look upon
as superfluous. From the accounts of former voyages and the facts which I
have related the character of the people will appear in as true a light
as by any description in my power to give. The length of time that we
remained at Otaheite, with the advantage of having been there before,
gave me opportunities of making perhaps a more perfect vocabulary of the
language than has yet appeared; but I have chosen to defer it for the
present as there is a probability that I may hereafter be better
qualified for such a task.

We left Otaheite with only two patients in the venereal list, which shows
that the disease has not gained ground. The natives say that it is of
little consequence, and we saw several instances of people that had been
infected who, after absenting themselves for 15 or 20 days, made their
appearance again without any visible symptom remaining of the disease.
Their method of cure I am unacquainted with; but their customary diet and
mode of living must contribute towards it. We saw a great many people
however with scrofulous habits and bad sores: these they denied to be
produced from any venereal cause; and our surgeon was of the same
opinion.

The result of the mean of 50 sets of lunar observations taken by me on
shore gives for the Longitude of Point Venus 210 degrees 33 minutes 57
seconds east.

Captain Cook in 1769 places it in 210 degrees 27 minutes 30 seconds east.

In 1777, his last voyage, 210 degrees 22 minutes 28 seconds east.

The tide in Toahroah harbour was very inconsiderable and not regular. The
greatest rise that I observed was 11 inches; but what was most singular
the time of high-water did not appear to be governed by the moon, it
being at the highest every day between noon and two o'clock. The variable
winds and weather at this time of the year has no doubt an influence on
the tides: on some days scarce any rise was perceptible.

1789. April. Sunday 5.

We steered towards the island Huaheine, which we got sight of the next
morning. At noon we brought to near the entrance of Owharre harbour, it
not being my intention to anchor. We could see every part of the harbour
distinctly, but my attention was particularly directed to the spot where
Omai's house had stood, no part of which was now visible. It was near
three o'clock before any canoes came off to us, for the people on shore
imagined that the ship was coming into the harbour. The first that
arrived had three men in it, who brought a few coconuts. I enquired about
the chief or Earee Rahie; and one of the fellows with great gravity said
he was the Earee Rahie, and that he had come to desire I would bring the
ship into the harbour. I could not help laughing at his impudence:
however I gave him a few nails for his coconuts and he left us.
Immediately after a double canoe in which were ten men came alongside;
among them was a young man who recollected and called me by my name.
Several other canoes arrived with hogs, yams, and other provisions, which
we purchased. My acquaintance told me that he had lived with our friend
Omai. He confirmed the account that had already been given and informed
me that of all the animals which had been left with Omai the mare only
remained alive. He said that Omai and himself had often rode together,
and I observed that many of the islanders who came on board had the
representation of a man on horseback tattooed on their legs. After the
death of Omai his house was broken to pieces and the materials stolen.
The firearms were at Ulietea but useless. I enquired after the seeds and
plants and was informed that they were all destroyed except one tree, but
of what kind that was I could not make out from their description. I was
much pressed to take the ship into the harbour, and Omai's companion
requested me to let him go to England. When they found that I would not
stop among them they seemed jealous of our going to Ulietea, and it
appeared to give them some satisfaction when I told them that I should
not go near that island.

The canoes had left us and we were making sail when we discovered an
Indian in the water swimming towards the shore, which in all probability
he would not have been able to reach. We took him up and luckily another
canoe coming alongside we put him in her. The people of the canoe said
that the man was insane, but how he came to be swimming so far from the
land we could not conjecture. At six o'clock we made sail and ran all
night to the south-west and south-west by south, between the islands
Huaheine and Ulietea. The next morning I altered the course, steering
more to the westward for the Friendly Islands.

Thursday 9.

On the 9th at nine o'clock in the morning the weather became squally and
a body of thick black clouds collected in the east. Soon after a
water-spout was seen at no great distance from us, which appeared to
great advantage from the darkness of the clouds behind it. As nearly as I
could judge it was about two feet diameter at the upper part, and about
eight inches at the lower. I had scarce made these remarks when I
observed that it was advancing rapidly towards the ship. We immediately
altered our course and took in all the sails except the foresail, soon
after which it passed within ten yards of our stern, making a rustling
noise but without our feeling the least effect from its being so near us.
The rate at which it travelled I judged to be about ten miles per hour
going towards the west in the direction of the wind. In a quarter of an
hour after passing us it dispersed. I never was so near a water-spout
before: the connection between the column, which was higher than our
mastheads, and the water below was no otherwise visible than by the sea
being disturbed in a circular space of about six yards in diameter, the
centre of which, from the whirling of the water round it, formed a
hollow; and from the outer part of the circle the water was thrown up
with much force in a spiral direction, and could be traced to the height
of fifteen or twenty feet. At this elevation we lost sight of it and
could see nothing of its junction with the column above. It is impossible
to say what injury we should have suffered if it had passed directly over
us. Masts I imagine might have been carried away, but I do not apprehend
it would have endangered the loss of a ship.

Saturday 11.

As we sailed very near the track made in former voyages I had little
reason to expect that we should at this time make any new discovery:
nevertheless on the 11th at daylight land was seen to the
south-south-west at about five leagues distance, which appeared to be an
island of a moderate height. On the north part was a round hill: the
north-west part was highest and steep: the south-east part sloped off to
a low point.

The wind had been westerly since the preceding noon, and at the time we
saw the land the ship was standing to the north-west. At six we tacked to
the southward, and as we advanced in that direction discovered a number
of low keys, of which at noon we counted nine: they were all covered with
trees. The large island first seen had a most fruitful appearance, its
shore being bordered with flat land, on which grew innumerable coconut
and other trees; and the higher grounds beautifully interspersed with
lawns. The wind being light and unfavourable we endeavoured all day but
without success to get near the land. In the night we had a heavy squall
which obliged us to clew up all our sails and soon after it fell calm.

Sunday 12.

The winds were light and variable all day with calms. At two in the
afternoon we were within three miles of the southernmost key and could
see a number of people within the reefs. Shortly after a canoe, in which
were four men, paddled off to us and came alongside without showing any
signs of apprehension or surprise. I gave them a few beads and they came
into the ship. One man, who seemed to have an ascendancy over the others,
looked about the ship with some appearance of curiosity, but none of them
would venture to go below. They asked for some boiled fresh pork which
they saw in a bowl belonging to one of the seaman, and it was given them
to eat with boiled plantains. Being told that I was the Earee or chief of
the ship the principal person came and joined noses with me, and
presented to me a large mother of pearl shell, which hung with plaited
hair round his neck; this he fastened round my neck with signs of great
satisfaction.

They spoke the same language as at Otaheite, with very little variation
as far as I could judge. In a small vocabulary that I made whilst
conversing with these men only four words out of twenty-four differed
from the Otaheite. The name of the large island they told me was
Wytootackee, and the Earee was called Lomakkayah. They said that there
were no hogs, dogs, or goats upon the island, nor had they yams, or
tarro; but that plantains, coconuts, fowls, breadfruit, and avees, were
there in great abundance. Notwithstanding they said that no hogs were on
the island it was evident they had seen such animals; for they called
them by the same name as is given to them at Otaheite, which made me
suspect that they were deceiving me. However I ordered a young boar and
sow to be put into their canoe with some yams and tarro, as we could
afford to part with some of these articles. I also gave to each of them a
knife, a small adze, some nails, beads, and a looking-glass. The latter
they examined with great curiosity; but with the ironwork they appeared
to be acquainted; calling it aouree, which is the common name for iron
among the islands where it is known.

As they were preparing to leave us the chief of the canoe took possession
of everything that I had given to the others. One of them showed some
signs of dissatisfaction, but after a little altercation they joined
noses and were reconciled. I now thought they were going to leave the
ship, but only two of them went into the canoe, the other two purposing
to stay all night with us and to have the canoe return for them in the
morning. I would have treated their confidence with the regard it merited
but it was impossible to say how far the ship might be driven from the
island in the night. This I explained to them and they reluctantly
consented to leave us. They were very solicitous that somebody from the
ship should go on shore with them, and just before they quitted us they
gave me a wooden spear which was the only thing, the paddles excepted,
they had brought with them in the canoe. It was a common longstaff
pointed with the toa wood.

The island of Wytootackee is about ten miles in circuit; its latitude
from 18 degrees 50 minutes to 18 degrees 54 minutes south, and longitude
200 degrees 19 minutes east. A group of small keys, eight in number, lie
to the south-east, four or five miles distant from Wytootackee and a
single one to the west-south-west; the southernmost of the group is in
latitude 18 degrees 58 minutes south. Variation of the compass 8 degrees
14 minutes east.

The people that came off to us did not differ in appearance from the
natives of Hervey's Islands, seen in Captain Cook's last voyage, though
much more friendly and inoffensive in their manners. They were tattooed
across the arms and legs, but not on the loins or posteriors, like the
people of Otaheite. From their knowledge of iron they have doubtless
communication with Hervey's Islands, which are not more than eighteen
leagues distant from them.

In the night a breeze sprang up from the south and we continued our
course to the westward.

Saturday 18.

On the 18th at sunset we saw Savage Island, and in the night passed by to
the southward of it.

Tuesday 21.

At eleven o'clock in the forenoon of the 21st we saw the island Caow from
the masthead, bearing north-west by west three-quarters west. This island
is a high mountain with a sharp-pointed top, and is the north-westernmost
of all the Friendly Islands. At noon we saw it very distinctly from the
deck, it being then nineteen leagues distant from us.

Thursday 23.

The wind being to the southward we could not fetch Annamooka, at which
island I intended to stop, before the evening of the 23rd, when we
anchored in the road in twenty-three fathoms, the extremes of Annamooka
bearing east by north and south by east, our distance from the shore
being half a league. In the middle of the day a canoe had come off to us
from the island Mango in which was a chief named Latoomy-lange, who dined
with me. Immediately on our anchoring several canoes came alongside with
yams and coconuts, but none of the natives offered to come on board
without first asking permission. As yet I had seen no person with whom I
could recollect to have been formerly acquainted. I made enquiries after
some of our old friends, particularly the chiefs, but I found myself not
sufficiently master of the language to obtain the information I wanted.

Friday 24.

Our station being inconvenient for watering at daylight we weighed, and
worked more to the eastward where we anchored in twenty-one fathoms; the
extremes of Annamooka bearing north 85 degrees east and south 33 degrees
west; the Sandy bay south 73 degrees east; our distance from the shore
half a league. Sounded all round the ship and found the ground to be a
coarse coral bottom, but with even soundings.

By this time some large sailing canoes were arrived from different
islands in the neighbourhood of Annamooka; and an old lame man named
Tepa, whom I had known in 1777 and immediately recollected, came on
board. Two other chiefs whose names were Noocaboo and Kunocappo were with
him. Tepa having formerly been accustomed to our manner of speaking their
language I found I could converse with him tolerably well. He informed me
that Poulaho, Feenow, and Tubow, were alive and at Tongataboo, and that
they would come hither as soon as they heard of our arrival, of which he
promised to send them immediate notice. He said that the cattle which we
had left at Tongataboo had all bred, and that the old ones were yet
living. He enquired after several people who were here with Captain Cook.
Being desirous to see the ship I took him and his companions below and
showed them the breadfruit and other plants, at seeing which they were
greatly surprised. I made each of them a present, and when they had
satisfied their curiosity I invited them to go on shore with me in the
ship's boat.

I took Nelson with me to procure some breadfruit plants, one of our stock
being dead and two or three others a little sickly. When we landed there
were about two hundred people on the beach, most of them women and
children. Tepa showed me a large boat-house which he told me we might
make use of, thinking we should have a party on shore as our ships had
formerly. I went with him in search of water but could find no better
place than where Captain Cook had watered, which is a quarter of a mile
inland from the east end of the beach. I next walked to the west point of
the bay where some plants and seeds had been sown by Captain Cook; and
had the satisfaction to see in a plantation close by about twenty fine
pineapple plants but no fruit, this not being the proper season. They
told me that they had eaten many of them, that they were fine and large,
and that at Tongataboo there were great numbers.

When I returned to the landing-place I was desired to sit down and a
present was brought me which consisted of some bundles of coconuts only.
This fell short of my expectations; however I appeared satisfied and
distributed beads and trinkets to the women and children near me.

Numerous were the marks of mourning with which these people disfigure
themselves, such as bloody temples, their heads deprived of most of the
hair, and what was worse almost all of them with the loss of some of
their fingers. Several fine boys, not above six years old, had lost both
their little fingers; and some of the men besides these had parted with
the middle finger of the right hand.

The chiefs went off with me to dinner, and I found a brisk trade carrying
on at the ship for yams; some plantains and breadfruit were likewise
brought on board but no hogs. In the afternoon more sailing canoes
arrived, some of which contained not less than ninety passengers. We
purchased eight hogs, some dogs, fowls, and shaddocks. Yams were in great
abundance, very fine and large; one yam weighed above forty-five pounds.
Among the people that came this afternoon were two of the name of Tubow,
which is a family of the first distinction among the Friendly Islands;
one of them was chief of the island Lefooga; with him and Tepa I went on
shore to see the wooding place. I found a variety of sizable trees but
the kind which I principally pitched upon was the Barringtonia of
Forster. I acquainted Tepa with my intention of sending people to cut
wood, which meeting with his approbation, we parted.

Saturday 25.

On the 25th at daylight the wooding and watering parties went on shore. I
had directed them not to cut the kind of tree* which, when Captain Cook
wooded here in 1777, blinded for a time many of the woodcutters. They had
not been an hour on shore before one man had an axe stolen from him and
another an adze. Tepa was applied to, who got the axe restored but the
adze was not recovered. In the evening we completed wooding.

(*Footnote. Excoecaria agallocha Linn. Sp. Pl. Called in the Malay
language caju mata boota, which signifies the the tree that wounds the
eyes.)

Sunday 26.

In the morning Nelson went on shore to get a few plants but, no principal
chief being among the people, he was insulted, and a spade taken from
him. A boat's grapnel was likewise stolen from the watering party. Tepa
recovered the spade for us, but the crowd of natives was become so great,
by the number of canoes that had arrived from different islands, that it
was impossible to do anything where there was such a multitude of people
without a chief of sufficient authority to command the whole. I therefore
ordered the watering party to go on board and determined to sail, for I
could not discover that any canoe had been sent to acquaint the chiefs of
Tongataboo of our being here. For some time after the thefts were
committed the chiefs kept away, but before noon they came on board.

At noon we unmoored, and at one o'clock got under sail. The two Tubows,
Kunocappo, Latoomy-lange, and another chief, were on board, and I
acquainted them that unless the grapnel was returned they must remain in
the ship. They were surprised and not a little alarmed. Canoes were
immediately despatched after the grapnel, which I was informed could not
possibly be brought to the ship before the next day, as those who had
stolen it immediately sailed with their prize to another island.
Nevertheless I detained them till sunset, when their uneasiness and
impatience increased to such a degree that they began to beat themselves
about the face and eyes and some of them cried bitterly. As this distress
was more than the grapnel was worth, and I had no reason to imagine that
they were privy to or in any manner concerned in the theft, I could not
think of detaining them longer and called their canoes alongside. I then
told them they were at liberty to go, and made each of them a present of
a hatchet, a saw, with some knives, gimblets, and nails. This unexpected
present and the sudden change in their situation affected them not less
with joy than they had before been with apprehension. They were unbounded
in their acknowledgments and I have little doubt but that we parted
better friends than if the affair had never happened.

We stood to the northward all night with light winds.

Monday 27.

And on the next day the 27th at noon were between the islands Tofoa and
Kotoo. Latitude observed 19 degrees 18 minutes south.

Thus far the voyage had advanced in a course of uninterrupted prosperity,
and had been attended with many circumstances equally pleasing and
satisfactory. A very different scene was now to be experienced. A
conspiracy had been formed which was to render all our past labour
productive only of extreme misery and distress. The means had been
concerted and prepared with so much secrecy and circumspection that no
one circumstance appeared to occasion the smallest suspicion of the
impending calamity.


CHAPTER 13.

A Mutiny in the Ship.

1789. April. Monday 27.

We kept near the island Kotoo all the afternoon in hopes that some canoes
would come off to the ship; but in this I was disappointed. The wind
being northerly in the evening we steered to the westward to pass to the
south of Tofoa. I gave directions for this course to be continued during
the night. The master had the first watch, the gunner the middle watch,
and Mr. Christian the morning watch. This was the turn of duty for the
night.

Tuesday 28.

Just before sun-rising, while I was yet asleep, Mr. Christian, with the
master at arms, gunner's mate, and Thomas Burkitt, seaman, came into my
cabin, and seizing me tied my hands with a cord behind my back,
threatening me with instant death if I spoke or made the least noise: I
however called as loud as I could in hopes of assistance; but they had
already secured the officers who were not of their party by placing
sentinels at their doors. There were three men at my cabin door besides
the four within; Christian had only a cutlass in his hand, the others had
muskets and bayonets. I was hauled out of bed and forced on deck in my
shirt, suffering great pain from the tightness which with they had tied
my hands. I demanded the reason of such violence but received no other
answer than abuse for not holding my tongue. The master, the gunner, the
surgeon, Mr. Elphinstone, master's mate, and Nelson, were kept confined
below; and the fore hatchway was guarded by sentinels. The boatswain and
carpenter, and also the clerk, Mr. Samuel, were allowed to come upon
deck, where they saw me standing abaft the mizenmast with my hands tied
behind my back under a guard with Christian at their head. The boatswain
was ordered to hoist the launch out with a threat if he did not do it
instantly TO TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF.

When the boat was out Mr. Hayward and Mr. Hallet, two of the midshipmen,
and Mr. Samuel, were ordered into it. I demanded what their intention was
in giving this order and endeavoured to persuade the people near me not
to persist in such acts of violence; but it was to no effect: "Hold your
tongue, Sir, or you are dead this instant," was constantly repeated to
me.

The master by this time had sent to request that he might come on deck,
which was permitted but he was soon ordered back again to his cabin.

I continued my endeavours to turn the tide of affairs, when Christian
changed the cutlass which he had in his hand for a bayonet that was
brought to him and, holding me with a strong grip by the cord that tied
my hands, he with many oaths threatened to kill me immediately if I would
not be quiet: the villains round me had their pieces cocked and bayonets
fixed. Particular people were called on to go into the boat and were
hurried over the side; whence I concluded that with these people I was to
be set adrift: I therefore made another effort to bring about a change
but with no other effect than to be threatened with having my brains
blown out.

The boatswain and seamen who were to go in the boat were allowed to
collect twine, canvas, lines, sails, cordage, an eight and twenty-gallon
cask of water, and Mr. Samuel got 150 pounds of bread, with a small
quantity of rum and wine, also a quadrant and compass; but he was
forbidden on pain of death to touch either map, ephemeris, book of
astronomical observations, sextant, timekeeper, or any of my surveys or
drawings.

The mutineers having forced those of the seamen whom they meant to get
rid of into the boat, Christian directed a dram to be served to each of
his own crew. I then unhappily saw that nothing could be done to effect
the recovery of the ship: there was no one to assist me, and every
endeavour on my part was answered with threats of death.

The officers were next called upon deck and forced over the side into the
boat, while I was kept apart from everyone, abaft the mizenmast;
Christian, armed with a bayonet, holding me by the bandage that secured
my hands. The guard round me had their pieces cocked, but on my daring
the ungrateful wretches to fire they uncocked them.

Isaac Martin, one of the guard over me, I saw had an inclination to
assist me, and as he fed me with shaddock (my lips being quite parched)
we explained our wishes to each other by our looks; but this being
observed Martin was removed from me. He then attempted to leave the ship,
for which purpose he got into the boat; but with many threats they
obliged him to return.

The armourer, Joseph Coleman, and two of the carpenters, McIntosh and
Norman, were also kept contrary to their inclination; and they begged of
me, after I was astern in the boat, to remember that they declared they
had no hand in the transaction. Michael Byrne, I am told, likewise wanted
to leave the ship.

It is of no moment for me to recount my endeavours to bring back the
offenders to a sense of their duty: all I could do was by speaking to
them in general; but it was to no purpose, for I was kept securely bound
and no one except the guard suffered to come near me.

To Mr. Samuel I am indebted for securing my journals and commission with
some material ship papers. Without these I had nothing to certify what I
had done, and my honour and character might have been suspected without
my possessing a proper document to have defended them. All this he did
with great resolution, though guarded and strictly watched. He attempted
to save the timekeeper, and a box with my surveys, drawings, and remarks
for fifteen years past, which were numerous, when he was hurried away,
with "Damn your eyes you are well off to get what you have."

It appeared to me that Christian was some time in doubt whether he should
keep the carpenter or his mates; at length he determined on the latter
and the carpenter was ordered into the boat. He was permitted but not
without some opposition to take his tool chest.

Much altercation took place among the mutinous crew during the whole
business: some swore "I'll be damned if he does not find his way home, if
he gets anything with him," (meaning me) and, when the carpenter's chest
was carrying away, "Damn my eyes he will have a vessel built in a month."
While others laughed at the helpless situation of the boat, being very
deep and so little room for those who were in her. As for Christian he
seemed as if meditating destruction on himself and everyone else.

I asked for arms but they laughed at me, and said I was well acquainted
with the people among whom I was going, and therefore did not want them;
four cutlasses however were thrown into the boat after we were veered
astern.

The officers and men being in the boat they only waited for me, of which
the master at arms informed Christian, who then said: "Come, captain
Bligh, your officers and men are now in the boat and you must go with
them; if you attempt to make the least resistance you will instantly be
put to death" and, without further ceremony, with a tribe of armed
ruffians about me, I was forced over the side where they untied my hands.
Being in the boat we were veered astern by a rope. A few pieces of pork
were thrown to us, and some clothes, also the cutlasses I have already
mentioned; and it was then that the armourer and carpenters called out to
me to remember that they had no hand in the transaction. After having
undergone a great deal of ridicule and been kept some time to make sport
for these unfeeling wretches we were at length cast adrift in the open
ocean.

I had with me in the boat the following persons:

John Fryer: Master.
Thomas Ledward: Acting Surgeon.
David Nelson: Botanist.
William Peckover: Gunner.
William Cole: Boatswain.
William Purcell: Carpenter.
William Elphinston: Master's Mate.
Thomas Hayward, John Hallet: Midshipman.
John Norton, Peter Linkletter: Quarter Masters.
Lawrence Lebogue: Sailmaker.
John Smith, Thomas Hall: Cooks.
George Simpson: Quarter Master's Mate.
Robert Tinkler: A boy.
Robert Lamb: Butcher.
Mr. Samuel: Clerk.

There remained on board the Bounty:

Fletcher Christian: Master's Mate.
Peter Haywood, Edward Young, George Stewart: Midshipmen.
Charles Churchill: Master at Arms.
John Mills: Gunner's Mate.
James Morrison: Boatswain's Mate.
Thomas Burkitt, Matthew Quintal, John Sumner, John Millward, William
McKoy, Henry Hillbrant, Michael Byrne, William Musprat, Alexander Smith,
John Williams, Thomas Ellison, Isaac Martin, Richard Skinner, Matthew
Thompson: Able Seamen.
William Brown: Gardener.
Joseph Coleman: Armourer.
Charles Norman: Carpenter's Mate.
Thomas McIntosh: Carpenter's Crew.

In all 25 hands, and the most able men of the ship's company.

Having little or no wind we rowed pretty fast towards Tofoa, which bore
north-east about 10 leagues from us. While the ship was in sight she
steered to the west-north-west, but I considered this only as a feint;
for when we were sent away "Huzza for Otaheite" was frequently heard
among the mutineers.

Christian the chief of the mutineers is of a respectable family in the
north of England. This was the third voyage he had made with me and, as I
found it necessary to keep my ship's company at three watches, I had
given him an order to take charge of the third, his abilities being
thoroughly equal to the task; and by this means the master and gunner
were not at watch and watch.

Haywood is also of a respectable family in the north of England and a
young man of abilities as well as Christian. These two had been objects
of my particular regard and attention, and I had taken great pains to
instruct them, having entertained hopes that as professional men they
would have become a credit to their country.

Young was well recommended and had the look of an able stout seaman: he
however fell short of what his appearance promised.

Stewart was a young man of creditable parents in the Orkneys, at which
place on the return of the Resolution from the South Seas in 1780 we
received so many civilities that on that account only I should gladly
have taken him with me but, independent of this recommendation, he was a
seaman and had always borne a good character.

Notwithstanding the roughness with which I was treated the remembrance of
past kindnesses produced some signs of remorse in Christian. When they
were forcing me out of the ship I asked him if this treatment was a
proper return for the many instances he had received of my friendship? he
appeared disturbed at my question and answered with much emotion: "That,
captain Bligh, that is the thing; I am in hell, I am in hell."

As soon as I had time to reflect I felt an inward satisfaction which
prevented any depression of my spirits: conscious of my integrity and
anxious solicitude for the good of the service in which I had been
engaged I found my mind wonderfully supported, and I began to conceive
hopes, notwithstanding so heavy a calamity, that I should one day be able
to account to my King and country for the misfortune. A few hours before
my situation had been peculiarly flattering. I had a ship in the most
perfect order and well stored with every necessary both for service and
health: by early attention to those particulars I had as much as lay in
my power, provided against any accident, in case I could not get through
Endeavour Straits, as well as against what might befall me in them; add
to this the plants had been successfully preserved in the most
flourishing state: so that upon the whole the voyage was two-thirds
completed, and the remaining part to all appearance in a very promising
way; every person on board being in perfect health, to establish which
was ever amongst the principal objects of my attention.

It will very naturally be asked what could be the reason for such a
revolt? in answer to which I can only conjecture that the mutineers had
flattered themselves with the hopes of a more happy life among the
Otaheiteans than they could possibly enjoy in England; and this, joined
to some female connections, most probably occasioned the whole
transaction.

The women at Otaheite are handsome, mild and cheerful in their manners
and conversation, possessed of great sensibility, and have sufficient
delicacy to make them admired and beloved. The chiefs were so much
attached to our people that they rather encouraged their stay among them
than otherwise, and even made them promises of large possessions. Under
these and many other attendant circumstances equally desirable it is now
perhaps not so much to be wondered at, though scarcely possible to have
been foreseen, that a set of sailors, most of them void of connections,
should be led away; especially when, in addition to such powerful
inducements, they imagined it in their power to fix themselves in the
midst of plenty on one of the finest islands in the world, where they
need not labour, and where the allurements of dissipation are beyond
anything that can be conceived. The utmost however that any commander
could have supposed to have happened is that some of the people would
have been tempted to desert. But, if it should be asserted that a
commander is to guard against an act of mutiny and piracy in his own ship
more than by the common rules of service, it is as much as to say that he
must sleep locked up and when awake be girded with pistols.

Desertions have happened more or less from most of the ships that have
been at the Society Islands; but it has always been in the commanders
power to make the chiefs return their people: the knowledge therefore
that it was unsafe to desert perhaps first led mine to consider with what
ease so small a ship might be surprised, and that so favourable an
opportunity would never offer to them again.

The secrecy of this mutiny is beyond all conception. Thirteen of the
party who were with me had always lived forward among the seamen; yet
neither they nor the messmates of Christian, Stewart, Haywood, and Young,
had ever observed any circumstance that made them in the least suspect
what was going on. To such a close-planned act of villainy, my mind being
entirely free from any suspicion, it is not wonderful that I fell a
sacrifice. Perhaps if there had been marines on board a sentinel at my
cabin-door might have prevented it; for I slept with the door always open
that the officer of the watch might have access to me on all occasions,
the possibility of such a conspiracy being ever the farthest from my
thoughts. Had their mutiny been occasioned by any grievances, either real
or imaginary, I must have discovered symptoms of their discontent, which
would have put me on my guard: but the case was far otherwise. Christian
in particular I was on the most friendly terms with: that very day he was
engaged to have dined with me, and the preceding night he excused himself
from supping with me on pretence of being unwell; for which I felt
concerned, having no suspicions of his integrity and honour.


CHAPTER 14.

Proceed in the Launch to the Island Tofoa.
Difficulty in obtaining Supplies there.
Treacherous Attack of the Natives.
Escape to Sea and bear away for New Holland.

1789. April.

My first determination was to seek a supply of breadfruit and water at
Tofoa, and afterwards to sail for Tongataboo, and there risk a
solicitation to Poulaho the king to equip our boat and grant us a supply
of water and provisions, so as to enable us to reach the East Indies.

The quantity of provisions I found in the boat was 150 pounds of bread,
16 pieces of pork, each piece weighing 2 pounds, 6 quarts of rum, 6
bottles of wine, with 28 gallons of water, and four empty barrecoes.

Fortunately it was calm all the afternoon till about four o'clock, when
we were so far to windward that, with a moderate easterly breeze which
sprung up, we were able to sail. It was nevertheless dark when we got to
Tofoa where I expected to land, but the shore proved to be so steep and
rocky that we were obliged to give up all thoughts of it and keep the
boat under the lee of the island with two oars, for there was no
anchorage. Having fixed on this mode of proceeding for the night I served
to every person half a pint of grog, and each took to his rest as well as
our unhappy situation would allow.

Wednesday 29.

In the morning at dawn of day we rowed along shore in search of a
landing-place, and about ten o'clock we discovered a cove with a stony
beach at the north-west part of the island, where I dropped the grapnel
within 20 yards of the rocks. A great surf ran on the shore but, as I was
unwilling to diminish our stock of provisions, I landed Mr. Samuel and
some others, who climbed the cliffs and got into the country to search
for supplies. The rest of us remained at the cove, not discovering any
other way into the country than that by which Mr. Samuel had proceeded.
It was great consolation to me to find that the spirits of my people did
not sink, notwithstanding our miserable and almost hopeless situation.
Towards noon Mr. Samuel returned with a few quarts of water which he had
found in holes; but he had met with no spring or any prospect of a
sufficient supply in that particular, and had seen only the signs of
inhabitants. As it was uncertain what might be our future necessities I
only issued a morsel of bread and a glass of wine to each person for
dinner.

I observed the latitude of this cove to be 19 degrees 41 minutes south.
This is the north-west part of Tofoa, the north-westernmost of the
Friendly Islands.

The weather was fair but the wind blew so strong from the east-south-east
that we could not venture to sea. Our detention made it absolutely
necessary to endeavour to obtain something towards our support; for I
determined if possible to keep our first stock entire. We therefore
weighed and rowed along shore to see if anything could be got; and at
last discovered some coconut trees; but they were on the top of high
precipices and the surf made it dangerous landing: both one and the other
we however got the better of. Some of the people with much difficulty
climbed the cliffs and got about 20 coconuts, and others flung them to
ropes, by which we hauled them through the surf into the boat. This was
all that could be done here and, as I found no place so safe as the one
we had left to spend the night at, I returned to the cove and, having
served a coconut to each person, we went to rest again in the boat.

Thursday 30.

At daylight we attempted to put to sea; but the wind and weather proved
so bad that I was glad to return to our former station where, after
issuing a morsel of bread and a spoonful of rum to each person, we
landed, and I went off with Mr. Nelson, Mr. Samuel, and some others, into
the country, having hauled ourselves up the precipice by long vines which
were fixed there by the natives for that purpose, this being the only way
into the country.

We found a few deserted huts and a small plantain walk but little taken
care of, from which we could only collect three small bunches of
plantains. After passing this place we came to a deep gully that led
towards a mountain near a volcano and, as I conceived that in the rainy
season very great torrents of water must pass through it, we hoped to
find sufficient for our use remaining in some holes of the rocks; but
after all our search the whole that we collected was only nine gallons.
We advanced within two miles of the foot of the highest mountain in the
island, on which is the volcano that is almost constantly burning. The
country near it is covered with lava and has a most dreary appearance. As
we had not been fortunate in our discoveries, and saw nothing to
alleviate our distresses except the plantains and water above-mentioned,
we returned to the boat exceedingly fatigued and faint. When I came to
the precipice whence we were to descend into the cove I was seized with
such a dizziness in my head that I thought it scarce possible to effect
it: however by the assistance of Nelson and others they at last got me
down, in a weak condition. Every person being returned by noon I gave
about an ounce of pork and two plantains to each, with half a glass of
wine. I again observed the latitude of this place 19 degrees 41 minutes
south. The people who remained by the boat I had directed to look for
fish or what they could pick up about the rocks; but nothing eatable
could be found: so that upon the whole we considered ourselves on as
miserable a spot of land as could well be imagined.

I could not say positively from the former knowledge I had of this island
whether it was inhabited or not; but I knew it was considered inferior to
the other islands, and I was not certain but that the Indians only
resorted to it at particular times. I was very anxious to ascertain this
point for, in case there had been only a few people here, and those could
have furnished us with but very moderate supplies, the remaining in this
spot to have made preparations for our voyage would have been preferable
to the risk of going amongst multitudes, where perhaps we might lose
everything. A party therefore sufficiently strong I determined should go
another route as soon as the sun became lower, and they cheerfully
undertook it.

About two o'clock in the afternoon the party set out but, after suffering
much fatigue, they returned in the evening without any kind of success.

At the head of the cove about 150 yards from the waterside there was a
cave; the distance across the stony beach was about 100 yards, and from
the country into the cove there was no other way than that which I have
already described. The situation secured us from the danger of being
surprised, and I determined to remain on shore for the night with a part
of my people that the others might have more room to rest in the boat
with the master, whom I directed to lie at a grapnel and be watchful in
case we should be attacked. I ordered one plantain for each person to be
boiled and, having supped on this scanty allowance with a quarter of a
pint of grog, and fixed the watches for the night, those whose turn it
was laid down to sleep in the cave, before which we kept up a good fire
yet notwithstanding we were much troubled with flies and mosquitoes.

May. Friday 1.

At dawn of day the party set out again in a different route to see what
they could find, in the course of which they suffered greatly for want of
water: they however met with two men, a woman, and a child: the men came
with them to the cove and brought two coconut shells of water. I
endeavoured to make friends of these people and sent them away for
breadfruit, plantains, and water. Soon after other natives came to us;
and by noon there were thirty about us, from whom we obtained a small
supply; but I could only afford one ounce of pork and a quarter of a
breadfruit to each man for dinner, with half a pint of water, for I was
fixed in my resolution not to use any of the bread or water in the boat.

No particular chief was yet among the natives: they were notwithstanding
tractable, and behaved honestly, exchanging the provisions they brought
for a few buttons and beads. The party who had been out informed me of
their having seen several neat plantations, so that it remained no longer
a doubt of there being settled inhabitants on the island, for which
reason I determined to get what I could, and to sail the first moment
that the wind and weather would allow us to put to sea.

I was much puzzled in what manner to account to the natives for the loss
of my ship: I knew they had too much sense to be amused with a story that
the ship was to join me, when she was not in sight from the hills. I was
at first doubtful whether I should tell the real fact or say that the
ship had overset and sunk, and that we only were saved: the latter
appeared to be the most proper and advantageous for us, and I accordingly
instructed my people, that we might all agree in one story. As I expected
enquiries were made about the ship, and they seemed readily satisfied
with our account; but there did not appear the least symptom of joy or
sorrow in their faces, although I fancied I discovered some marks of
surprise. Some of the natives were coming and going the whole afternoon,
and we got enough of breadfruit, plantains, and coconuts for another day;
but of water they only brought us about five pints. A canoe also came in
with four men and brought a few coconuts and breadfruit which I bought as
I had done the rest. Nails were much enquired after, but I would not
suffer any to be shown as they were wanted for the use of the boat.

Towards evening I had the satisfaction to find our stock of provisions
somewhat increased, but the natives did not appear to have much to spare.
What they brought was in such small quantities that I had no reason to
hope we should be able to procure from them sufficient to stock us for
our voyage. At sunset all the natives left us in quiet possession of the
cove. I thought this a good sign, and made no doubt that they would come
again the next day with a better supply of food and water, with which I
hoped to sail without farther delay: for if in attempting to get to
Tongataboo we should be driven to leeward of the islands there would be a
larger quantity of provisions to support us against such a misfortune.

At night I served a quarter of a breadfruit and a coconut to each person
for supper and, a good fire being made, all but the watch went to sleep.

Saturday 2.

At daybreak the next morning I was pleased to find everyone's spirits a
little revived, and that they no longer regarded me with those anxious
looks which had constantly been directed towards me since we lost sight
of the ship: every countenance appeared to have a degree of cheerfulness,
and they all seemed determined to do their best.

As there was no certainty of our being supplied with water by the natives
I sent a party among the gullies in the mountains with empty shells to
see what could be found. In their absence the natives came about us as I
expected, and in greater numbers; two canoes also came in from round the
north side of the island. In one of them was an elderly chief called
Maccaackavow. Soon after some of our foraging party returned, and with
them came a good-looking chief called Egijeefow, or perhaps more properly
Eefow, Egij or Eghee, signifying a chief. To each of these men I made a
present of an old shirt and a knife, and I soon found they either had
seen me or had heard of my being at Annamooka. They knew I had been with
captain Cook, who they inquired after, and also captain Clerk. They were
very inquisitive to know in what manner I had lost my ship. During this
conversation a young man named Nageete appeared, whom I remembered to
have seen at Annamooka: he expressed much pleasure at our meeting. I
enquired after Poulaho and Feenow, who they said were at Tongataboo; and
Eefow agreed to accompany me thither if I would wait till the weather
moderated. The readiness and affability of this man gave me much
satisfaction.

This however was but of short duration for the natives began to increase
in number and I observed some symptoms of a design against us. Soon after
they attempted to haul the boat on shore, on which I brandished my
cutlass in a threatening manner and spoke to Eefow to desire them to
desist, which they did and everything became quiet again. My people who
had been in the mountains now returned with about three gallons of water.
I kept buying up the little breadfruit that was brought to us, and
likewise some spears to arm my men with, having only four cutlasses, two
of which were in the boat. As we had no means of improving our situation
I told our people I would wait till sunset, by which time perhaps
something might happen in our favour: for if we attempted to go at
present we must fight our way through, which we could do more
advantageously at night; and that in the meantime we would endeavour to
get off to the boat what we had bought. The beach was lined with the
natives and we heard nothing but the knocking of stones together, which
they had in each hand. I knew very well this was the sign of an attack.
At noon I served a coconut and a breadfruit to each person for dinner,
and gave some to the chiefs, with whom I continued to appear intimate and
friendly. They frequently importuned me to sit down but I as constantly
refused: for it occurred both to Nelson and myself that the intended to
seize hold of me if I gave them such an opportunity. Keeping therefore
constantly on our guard we were suffered to eat our uncomfortable meal in
some quietness.

After dinner we began by little and little to get our things into the
boat, which was a troublesome business on account of the surf. I
carefully watched the motions of the natives, who continued to increase
in number, and found that, instead of their intention being to leave us,
fires were made, and places fixed on for their stay during the night.
Consultations were also held among them and everything assured me we
should be attacked. I sent orders to the master that when he saw us
coming down he should keep the boat close to the shore that we might the
more readily embark.

I had my journal on shore with me, writing the occurrences in the cave
and in sending it down to the boat, it was nearly snatched away but for
the timely assistance of the gunner.

The sun was near setting when I gave the word, on which every person who
was on shore with me boldly took up his proportion of things and carried
them to the boat. The chiefs asked me if I would not stay with them all
night. I said: "No, I never sleep out of my boat; but in the morning we
will again trade with you, and I shall remain till the weather is
moderate that we may go, as we have agreed, to see Poulaho at
Tongataboo." Maccaackavow then got up and said: "You will not sleep on
shore? then Mattie" (which directly signifies we will kill you) and he
left me. The onset was now preparing; everyone as I have described before
kept knocking stones together, and Eefow quitted me. All but two or three
things were in the boat, when I took Nageete by the hand, and we walked
down the beach, everyone in a silent kind of horror.

While I was seeing the people embark Nageete wanted me to stay to speak
to Eefow, but I found he was encouraging them to the attack, and it was
my determination if they had then begun to have killed him for his
treacherous behaviour. I ordered the carpenter not to quit me till the
other people were in the boat. Nageete, finding I would not stay, loosed
himself from my hold and went off, and we all got into the boat except
one man who, while I was getting on board, quitted it and ran up the
beach to cast the stern fast off, notwithstanding the master and others
called to him to return while they were hauling me out of the water.

I was no sooner in the boat than the attack began by about 200 men; the
unfortunate poor man who had run up the beach was knocked down, and the
stones flew like a shower of shot. Many Indians got hold of the stern
rope and were near hauling the boat on shore, which they would certainly
have effected if I had not had a knife in my pocket with which I cut the
rope. We then hauled off to the grapnel, everyone being more or less
hurt. At this time I saw five of the natives about the poor man they had
killed, and two of them were beating him about the head with stones in
their hands.

We had no time to reflect for to my surprise they filled their canoes
with stones, and twelve men came off after us to renew the attack, which
they did so effectually as nearly to disable us all. Our grapnel was foul
but Providence here assisted us; the fluke broke and we got to our oars
and pulled to sea. They however could paddle round us, so that we were
obliged to sustain the attack without being able to return it, except
with such stones as lodged in the boat, and in this I found we were very
inferior to them. We could not close because our boat was lumbered and
heavy, of which they knew how to take advantage: I therefore adopted the
expedient of throwing overboard some clothes which, as I expected, they
stopped to pick up and, as it was by this time almost dark, they gave
over the attack and returned towards the shore leaving us to reflect on
our unhappy situation.

The poor man killed by the natives was John Norton: this was his second
voyage with me as a quartermaster, and his worthy character made me
lament his loss very much. He has left an aged parent I am told, whom he
supported.

I once before sustained an attack of a similar nature with a smaller
number of Europeans against a multitude of Indians: it was after the
death of Captain Cook on the Morai at Owhyhee, where I was left by
Lieutenant King. Yet notwithstanding this experience I had not an idea
that the power of a man's arm could throw stones from two to eight pounds
weight with such force and exactness as these people did. Here unhappily
we were without firearms, which the Indians knew; and it was a fortunate
circumstance that they did not begin to attack us in the cave; for in
that case our destruction must have been inevitable, and we should have
had nothing left for it but to sell our lives as dearly as we could, in
which I found everyone cheerfully disposed to concur. This appearance of
resolution deterred them, supposing that they could effect their purpose
without risk after we were in the boat.

Taking this as a sample of the disposition of the natives there was but
little reason to expect much benefit by persevering in the intention of
visiting Poulaho; for I considered their good behaviour formerly to have
proceeded from a dread of our firearms, and which therefore was likely to
cease, as they knew we were now destitute of them: and even supposing our
lives not in danger the boat and everything we had would most probably be
taken from us, and thereby all hopes precluded of ever being able to
return to our native country.

We set our sails and steered along shore by the west side of the island
Tofoa, the wind blowing fresh from the eastward. My mind was employed in
considering what was best to be done when I was solicited by all hands to
take them towards home: and when I told them that no hopes of relief for
us remained (except what might be found at New Holland) till I came to
Timor, a distance of full 1200 leagues, where there was a Dutch
settlement, but in what part of the island I knew not, they all agreed to
live on one ounce of bread and a quarter of a pint of water per day.
Therefore after examining our stock of provisions and recommending to
them in the most solemn manner not to depart from their promise, we bore
away across a sea where the navigation is but little known, in a small
boat twenty-three feet long from stem to stern, deep laden with eighteen
men. I was happy however to see that everyone seemed better satisfied
with our situation than myself.

Our stock of provisions consisted of about one hundred and fifty pounds
of bread, twenty-eight gallons of water, twenty pounds of pork, three
bottles of wine, and five quarts of rum. The difference between this and
the quantity we had on leaving the ship was principally owing to our loss
in the bustle and confusion of the attack. A few coconuts were in the
boat and some breadfruit, but the latter was trampled to pieces.


CHAPTER 15.

Passage towards New Holland.
Islands discovered in our Route.
Our great Distresses.
See the Reefs of New Holland and find a Passage through them.

1789. May.

It was about eight o'clock at night when we bore away under a reefed lug
fore-sail and, having divided the people into watches and got the boat in
a little order, we returned God thanks for our miraculous preservation
and, fully confident of his gracious support, I found my mind more at
ease than it had been for some time past.

Sunday 3.

At daybreak the gale increased; the sun rose very fiery and red, a sure
indication of a severe gale of wind. At eight it blew a violent storm and
the sea ran very high, so that between the seas the sail was becalmed,
and when on the top of the sea it was too much to have set: but we could
not venture to take in the sail for we were in very imminent danger and
distress, the sea curling over the stern of the boat, which obliged us to
bale with all our might. A situation more distressing has perhaps seldom
been experienced.

Our bread was in bags and in danger of being spoiled by the wet: to be
starved to death was inevitable if this could not be prevented: I
therefore began to examine what clothes there were in the boat and what
other things could be spared and, having determined that only two suits
should be kept for each person, the rest was thrown overboard with some
rope and spare sails, which lightened the boat considerably, and we had
more room to bale the water out. Fortunately the carpenter had a good
chest in the boat, in which we secured the bread the first favourable
moment. His tool chest also was cleared and the tools stowed in the
bottom of the boat so that this became a second convenience.

I served a teaspoonful of rum to each person (for we were very wet and
cold) with a quarter of a breadfruit, which was scarce eatable, for
dinner: our engagement was now strictly to be carried into execution, and
I was fully determined to make our provisions last eight weeks, let the
daily proportion be ever so small.

At noon I considered our course and distance from Tofoa to be
west-north-west three-quarters west 86 miles, latitude 19 degrees 27
minutes south. I directed the course to the west-north-west that we might
get a sight of the islands called Feejee if they laid in the direction
the natives had pointed out to me.

The weather continued very severe, the wind veering from north-east to
east-south-east. The sea ran higher than in the forenoon, and the fatigue
of baling to keep the boat from filling was exceedingly great. We could
do nothing more than keep before the sea, in the course of which the boat
performed so well that I no longer dreaded any danger in that respect.
But, among the hardships we were to undergo, that of being constantly wet
was not the least.

Monday 4.

The night was very cold and at daylight our limbs were so benumbed that
we could scarce find the use of them. At this time I served a teaspoonful
of rum to each person, from which we all found great benefit.

As I have mentioned before I determined to keep to the west-north-west
till I got more to the northward, for I not only expected to have better
weather but to see the Feejee Islands, as I have often understood from
the natives of Annamooka that they lie in that direction. Captain Cook
likewise considered them to be north-west by west from Tongataboo. Just
before noon we discovered a small flat island of a moderate height
bearing west-south-west 4 or 5 leagues. I observed our latitude to be 18
degrees 58 minutes south; our longitude was by account 3 degrees 4
minutes west from the island of Tofoa, having made a north 72 degrees
west course, distance 95 miles, since yesterday noon. I divided five
small coconuts for our dinner and everyone was satisfied.

A little after noon other islands appeared, and at a quarter past three
o'clock we could count eight, bearing from south round by the west to
north-west by north, those to the south which were the nearest being four
leagues distant from us.

I kept my course to the north-west by west between the islands, the gale
having considerably abated. At six o'clock we discovered three other
small islands to the north-west, the westernmost of them bore north-west
half west 7 leagues. I steered to the southward of these islands a
west-north-west course for the night under a reefed sail.

Served a few broken pieces of breadfruit for supper and performed
prayers.

The night turned out fair and, having had tolerable rest, everyone seemed
considerably better in the morning, and contentedly breakfasted on a few
pieces of yams that were found in the boat. After breakfast we examined
our bread, a great deal of which was damaged and rotten; this
nevertheless we were glad to keep for use.

I had hitherto been scarcely able to keep any account of our run, but we
now equipped ourselves a little better by getting a log-line marked and,
having practised at counting seconds, several could do it with some
degree of exactness.

The islands we had passed lie between the latitude of 19 degrees 5
minutes south and 18 degrees 19 minutes south, and according to my
reckoning from 3 degrees 17 minutes to 3 degrees 46 minutes west
longitude from the island Tofoa: the largest may be about six leagues in
circuit; but it is impossible for me to be very correct. To show where
they are to be found again is the most my situation enabled me to do. The
sketch I have made will give a comparative view of their extent. I
believe all the larger islands are inhabited as they appeared very
fertile.

At noon I observed in latitude 18 degrees 10 seconds south and considered
my course and distance from yesterday noon north-west by west half west
94 miles; longitude by account from Tofoa 4 degrees 29 minutes west.

For dinner I served some of the damaged bread and a quarter of a pint of
water.

About six o'clock in the afternoon we discovered two islands, one bearing
west by south 6 leagues and the other north-west by north 8 leagues; I
kept to windward of the northernmost and, passing it by 10 o'clock, I
resumed our course to the north-west and west-north-west for the night.

Wednesday 6.

The weather was fair and the wind moderate all day from the
east-north-east. At daylight a number of other islands were in sight from
south-south-east to the west and round to north-east by east; between
those in the north-west I determined to pass. At noon a small sandy
island or key two miles distant from me bore from east to south
three-quarters west. I had passed ten islands, the largest of which I
judged to be 6 or 8 leagues in circuit. Much larger lands appeared in the
south-west and north-north-west, between which I directed my course.
Latitude observed 17 degrees 17 minutes south; course since yesterday
noon north 50 degrees west; distance 84 miles; longitude made by account
5 degrees 37 minutes west.

Our allowance for the day was a quarter of a pint of coconut milk and the
meat, which did not exceed two ounces to each person: it was received
very contentedly but we suffered great drought. I durst not venture to
land as we had no arms and were less capable of defending ourselves than
we were at Tofoa.

To keep an account of the boat's run was rendered difficult from being
constantly wet with the sea breaking over us but, as we advanced towards
the land, the sea became smoother and I was enabled to form a sketch of
the islands which will serve to give a general knowledge of their extent
and position. Those we were near appeared fruitful and hilly, some very
mountainous and all of a good height.

To our great joy we hooked a fish, but we were miserably disappointed by
its being lost in trying to get it into the boat.

We continued steering to the north-west between the islands which by the
evening appeared of considerable extent, woody and mountainous. At sunset
the southernmost bore from south to south-west by west and the
northernmost from north by west half west to north-east half east. At six
o'clock we were nearly midway between them and about 6 leagues distant
from each shore when we fell in with a coral bank, on which we had only
four feet water, without the least break on it or ruffle of the sea to
give us warning. I could see that it extended about a mile on each side
of us, but as it is probable that it may extend much further I have laid
it down so in my sketch.

I directed the course west by north for the night, and served to each
person an ounce of the damaged bread and a quarter of a pint of water for
supper.

As our lodgings were very miserable and confined for want of room I
endeavoured to remedy the latter defect by putting ourselves at watch and
watch; so that one half always sat up while the other lay down on the
boat's bottom or upon a chest, with nothing to cover us but the heavens.
Our limbs were dreadfully cramped for we could not stretch them out, and
the nights were so cold, and we so constantly wet, that after a few hours
sleep we could scarce move.

Thursday 7.

At dawn of day we again discovered land from west-south-west to
west-north-west, and another island north-north-west, the latter a high
round lump of but little extent: the southern land that we had passed in
the night was still in sight. Being very wet and cold I served a spoonful
of rum and a morsel of bread for breakfast.

The land in the west was distinguished by some extraordinary high rocks
which, as we approached them, assumed a variety of forms. The country
appeared to be agreeably interspersed with high and low land, and in some
places covered with wood. Off the north-east part lay some small rocky
islands, between which and an island 4 leagues to the north-east I
directed my course; but a lee current very unexpectedly set us very near
to the rocky isles, and we could only get clear of it by rowing, passing
close to the reef that surrounded them. At this time we observed two
large sailing canoes coming swiftly after us along shore and, being
apprehensive of their intentions, we rowed with some anxiety, fully
sensible of our weak and defenceless state. At noon it was calm and the
weather cloudy; my latitude is therefore doubtful to 3 or 4 miles. Our
course since yesterday noon north-west by west, distance 79 miles;
latitude by account 16 degrees 29 minutes south, and longitude by account
from Tofoa 6 degrees 46 minutes west. Being constantly wet it was with
the utmost difficulty I could open a book to write, and I am sensible
that what I have done can only serve to point out where these lands are
to be found again, and give an idea of their extent.

All the afternoon we had light winds at north-north-east: the weather was
very rainy, attended with thunder and lightning. Only one of the canoes
gained upon us, which by three o'clock in the afternoon was not more than
two miles off, when she gave over chase.

If I may judge from the sail of these vessels they are of a similar
construction with those at the Friendly Islands which, with the nearness
of their situation, gives reason to believe that they are the same kind
of people. Whether these canoes had any hostile intention against us must
remain a doubt: perhaps we might have benefited by an intercourse with
them, but in our defenceless situation to have made the experiment would
have been risking too much.

I imagine these to be the islands called Feejee as their extent,
direction, and distance from the Friendly Islands answers to the
description given of them by those Islanders. Heavy rain came on at four
o'clock, when every person did their utmost to catch some water, and we
increased our stock to 34 gallons, besides quenching our thirst for the
first time since we had been at sea; but an attendant consequence made us
pass the night very miserably for, being extremely wet and having no dry
things to shift or cover us, we experienced cold and shiverings scarce to
be conceived. Most fortunately for us the forenoon turned out fair and we
stripped and dried our clothes. The allowance I issued today was an ounce
and a half of pork, a teaspoonful of rum, half a pint of coconut milk,
and an ounce of bread. The rum though so small in quantity was of the
greatest service. A fishing-line was generally towing from the stern of
the boat but though we saw great numbers of fish we could never catch
one.

At noon I observed in latitude 16 degrees 4 minutes south and found we
had made a course from yesterday noon north 62 degrees west distance 62
miles; longitude by account from Tofoa 7 degrees 42 minutes west.

The land passed yesterday and the day before is a group of islands, 14 or
16 in number, lying between the latitude of 16 degrees 26 minutes south
and 17 degrees 57 minutes south, and in longitude by my account 4 degrees
47 minutes to 7 degrees 17 minutes west from Tofoa. Three of these
islands are very large, having from 30 to 40 leagues of sea-coast.

In the afternoon we cleaned out the boat and it employed us till sunset
to get everything dry and in order. Hitherto I had issued the allowance
by guess, but I now made a pair of scales with two coconut shells and,
having accidentally some pistol-balls in the boat, 25 of which weighed
one pound or 16 ounces, I adopted one,* as the proportion of weight that
each person should receive of bread at the times I served it. I also
amused all hands with describing the situation of New Guinea and New
Holland, and gave them every information in my power that in case any
accident happened to me those who survived might have some idea of what
they were about, and be able to find their way to Timor, which at present
they knew nothing of more than the name and some not even that. At night
I served a quarter of a pint of water and half an ounce of bread for
supper.

(*Footnote. It weighed 272 grains.)

Saturday 9.

In the morning a quarter of a pint of coconut milk and some of the
decayed bread was served for breakfast, and for dinner I divided the meat
of four coconuts with the remainder of the rotten bread, which was only
eatable by such distressed people.

At noon I observed the latitude to be 15 degrees 47 minutes south; course
since yesterday north 75 degrees west distance 64 miles; longitude made
by account 8 degrees 45 minutes west.

In the afternoon I fitted a pair of shrouds for each mast, and contrived
a canvas weather cloth round the boat, and raised the quarters about nine
inches by nailing on the seats of the stern sheets, which proved of great
benefit to us.

The wind had been moderate all day in the south-east quarter with fine
weather; but about nine o'clock in the evening the clouds began to
gather, and we had a prodigious fall of rain with severe thunder and
lightning. By midnight we caught about twenty gallons of water. Being
miserably wet and cold I served to the people a teaspoonful of rum each
to enable them to bear with their distressed situation. The weather
continued extremely bad and the wind increased; we spent a very miserable
night without sleep except such as could be got in the midst of rain. The
day brought no relief but its light. The sea broke over us so much that
two men were constantly baling; and we had no choice how to steer, being
obliged to keep before the waves for fear of the boat filling.

The allowance now regularly served to each person was one 25th of a pound
of bread and a quarter of a pint of water, at eight in the morning, at
noon, and at sunset. Today I gave about half an ounce of pork for dinner
which, though any moderate person would have considered only as a
mouthful, was divided into three or four.

The rain abated towards noon and I observed the latitude to be 15 degrees
17 minutes south; course north 67 degrees west distance 78 miles;
longitude made 10 degrees west.

The wind continued strong from south-south-east to south-east with very
squally weather and a high breaking sea, so that we were miserably wet
and suffered great cold in the night.

Monday 11.

In the morning at daybreak I served to every person a teaspoonful of rum,
our limbs being so cramped that we could scarce move them. Our situation
was now extremely dangerous, the sea frequently running over our stern,
which kept us baling with all our strength.

At noon the sun appeared, which gave us as much pleasure as in a winter's
day in England. I issued the 25th of a pound of bread and a quarter of a
pint of water, as yesterday. Latitude observed 14 degrees 50 minutes
south; course north 71 degrees west distance 102 miles; and longitude by
account 11 degrees 39 minutes west from Tofoa.

In the evening it rained hard and we again experienced a dreadful night.

Tuesday 12.

At length the day came and showed to me a miserable set of beings, full
of wants, without anything to relieve them. Some complained of great pain
in their bowels, and everyone of having almost lost the use of his limbs.
The little sleep we got was no ways refreshing as we were covered with
sea and rain. I served a spoonful of rum at day-dawn, and the usual
allowance of bread and water for breakfast, dinner, and supper.

At noon it was almost calm, no sun to be seen, and some of us shivering
with cold. Course since yesterday west by north distance 89 miles;
latitude by account 14 degrees 33 minutes south; longitude made 13
degrees 9 minutes west. The direction of our course was to pass to the
northward of the New Hebrides.

The wet weather continued and in the afternoon the wind came from the
southward, blowing fresh in squalls. As there was no prospect of getting
our clothes dried I recommended to everyone to strip and wring them
through the salt water, by which means they received a warmth that while
wet with rain they could not have.

This afternoon we saw a kind of fruit on the water which Nelson told me
was the Barringtonia of Forster and, as I saw the same again in the
morning, and some men-of-war birds, I was led to believe that we were not
far from land.

We continued constantly shipping seas and baling, and were very wet and
cold in the night; but I could not afford the allowance of rum at
daybreak.

Wednesday 13.

At noon I had a sight of the sun, latitude 14 degrees 17 minutes south.
Course west by north 79 miles; longitude made 14 degrees 28 minutes west.
All this day we were constantly shipping water and suffered much cold and
shiverings in the night.

Thursday 14.

Fresh gales at south-east and gloomy weather with rain and a high sea. At
six in the morning we saw land from south-west by south eight leagues to
north-west by west three-quarters west six leagues, which soon after
appeared to be four islands, one of them much larger than the others, and
all of them high and remarkable. At noon we discovered a small island and
some rocks bearing north-west by north four leagues, and another island
west eight leagues, so that the whole were six in number; the four I had
first seen bearing from south half east to south-west by south; our
distance three leagues from the nearest island. My latitude observed was
13 degrees 29 minutes south, and longitude by account from Tofoa 15
degrees 49 minutes west; course since yesterday noon north 63 degrees
west distance 89 miles. At four in the afternoon we passed the
westernmost island.

Friday 15.

At one in the morning another island was discovered bearing
west-north-west five leagues distance, and at eight o'clock we saw it for
the last time bearing north-east seven leagues. A number of gannets,
boobies, and men-of-war birds were seen.

These islands lie between the latitude of 13 degrees 16 minutes and 14
degrees 10 minutes south: their longitude according to my reckoning 15
degrees 51 minutes to 17 degrees 6 minutes west from the island Tofoa.*
The largest island I judged to be about twenty leagues in circuit, the
others five or six. The easternmost is the smallest island and most
remarkable, having a high sugar loaf hill.

(*Footnote. By making a proportional allowance for the error afterwards
found in the dead reckoning I estimate the longitude of these islands to
be from 167 degrees 17 minutes east to 168 degrees 34 minutes east from
Greenwich.)

The sight of these islands served only to increase the misery of our
situation. We were very little better than starving with plenty in view;
yet to attempt procuring any relief was attended with so much danger that
prolonging of life, even in the midst of misery, was thought preferable,
while there remained hopes of being able to surmount our hardships. For
my own part I consider the general run of cloudy and wet weather to be a
blessing of Providence. Hot weather would have caused us to have died
with thirst; and probably being so constantly covered with rain or sea
protected us from that dreadful calamity.

As I had nothing to assist my memory I could not then determine whether
these islands were a part of the New Hebrides or not: I believe them to
be a new discovery which I have since found true but, though they were
not seen either by Monsieur Bougainville or Captain Cook, they are so
nearly in the neighbourhood of the New Hebrides that they must be
considered as part of the same group. They are fertile and inhabited, as
I saw smoke in several places.

The wind was at south-east with rainy weather all day. The night was very
dark, not a star could be seen to steer by, and the sea broke continually
over us. I found it necessary to counteract as much as possible the
effect of the southerly winds to prevent being driven too near New
Guinea, for in general we were forced to keep so much before the sea that
if we had not, at intervals of moderate weather, steered a more southerly
course we should inevitably from a continuance of the gales have been
thrown in sight of that coast: in which case there would most probably
have been an end to our voyage.

Saturday 16.

In addition to our miserable allowance of one 25th of a pound of bread
and a quarter of a pint of water I issued for dinner about an ounce of
salt pork to each person. I was often solicited for this pork, but I
considered it more proper to issue it in small quantities than to suffer
it to be all used at once or twice, which would have been done if I had
allowed it.

At noon I observed in 13 degrees 33 minutes south, longitude made from
Tofoa 19 degrees 27 minutes west; course north 82 degrees west, distance
101 miles. The sun breaking out through the clouds gave us hopes of
drying our wet clothes, but the sunshine was of short duration. We had
strong breezes at south-east by south and dark gloomy weather with storms
of thunder, lightning, and rain. The night was truly horrible, and not a
star to be seen; so that our steerage was uncertain.

Sunday 17.

At dawn of day I found every person complaining, and some of them
solicited extra allowance, which I positively refused. Our situation was
miserable: always wet, and suffering extreme cold in the night without
the least shelter from the weather. Being constantly obliged to bale to
keep the boat from filling was perhaps not to be reckoned an evil as it
gave us exercise.

The little rum we had was of great service: when our nights were
particularly distressing I generally served a teaspoonful or two to each
person: and it was always joyful tidings when they heard of my
intentions.

At noon a water-spout was very near on board of us. I issued an ounce of
pork in addition to the allowance of bread and water; but before we began
to eat every person stripped and, having wrung their clothes through the
seawater, found much warmth and refreshment. Course since yesterday noon
west-south-west distance 100 miles; latitude by account 14 degrees 11
minutes south and longitude made 21 degrees 3 minutes west.

The night was dark and dismal: the sea constantly breaking over us and
nothing but the wind and waves to direct our steerage. It was my
intention if possible to make New Holland to the southward of Endeavour
straits, being sensible that it was necessary to preserve such a
situation as would make a southerly wind a fair one, that we might range
along the reefs till an opening should be found into smooth water, and we
the sooner be able to pick up some refreshments.

Monday 18.

In the morning the rain abated, when we stripped and wrung our clothes
through the seawater as usual, which refreshed us greatly. Every person
complained of violent pain in their bones; I was only surprised that no
one was yet laid up. The customary allowance of one 25th of a pound of
bread and a quarter of a pint of water was served at breakfast, dinner,
and supper.

At noon I deduced my situation by account, for we had no glimpse of the
sun, to be in latitude 14 degrees 52 minutes south; course since
yesterday noon west-south-west 106 miles; longitude made from Tofoa 22
degrees 45 minutes west. Saw many boobies and noddies, a sign of being in
the neighbourhood of land. In the night we had very severe lightning with
heavy rain and were obliged to keep baling without intermission.

Tuesday 19.

Very bad weather and constant rain. At noon latitude by account 14
degrees 37 minutes south; course since yesterday north 81 degrees west,
distance 100 miles; longitude made 24 degrees 30 minutes west. With the
allowance of bread and water served half an ounce of pork to each person
for dinner.

Wednesday 20.

Fresh breezes east-north-east with constant rain, at times a deluge.
Always baling.

At dawn of day some of my people seemed half dead: our appearances were
horrible, and I could look no way but I caught the eye of someone in
distress. Extreme hunger was now too evident, but no one suffered from
thirst, nor had we much inclination to drink, that desire perhaps being
satisfied through the skin. The little sleep we got was in the midst of
water, and we constantly awoke with severe cramps and pains in our bones.
This morning I served about two teaspoonfuls of rum to each person and
the allowance of bread and water as usual. At noon the sun broke out and
revived everyone. I found we were in latitude 14 degrees 49 minutes
south; longitude made 25 degrees 46 minutes west; course south 88 degrees
west distance 75 miles.

All the afternoon we were so covered with rain and salt water that we
could scarcely see. We suffered extreme cold and everyone dreaded the
approach of night. Sleep, though we longed for it, afforded no comfort:
for my own part I almost lived without it.

Thursday 21.

About two o'clock in the morning we were overwhelmed with a deluge of
rain. It fell so heavy that we were afraid it would fill the boat, and
were obliged to bale with all our might. At dawn of day I served a larger
allowance of rum. Towards noon the rain abated and the sun shone, but we
were miserably cold and wet, the sea breaking constantly over us so that,
notwithstanding the heavy rain, we had not been able to add to our stock
of fresh water. Latitude by observation 14 degrees 29 minutes south, and
longitude made by account from Tofoa 27 degrees 25 minutes west; course
since yesterday noon north 78 degrees west 99 miles. I now considered
myself nearly on a meridian with the east part of New Guinea.

Friday 22.

Strong gales from east-south-east to south-south-east, a high sea, and
dark dismal night.

Our situation this day was extremely calamitous. We were obliged to take
the course of the sea, running right before it and watching with the
utmost care as the least error in the helm would in a moment have been
our destruction.

At noon it blew very hard and the foam of the sea kept running over our
stern and quarters; I however got propped up and made an observation of
the latitude in 14 degrees 17 minutes south; course north 85 degrees west
distance 130 miles; longitude made 29 degrees 38 minutes west.

The misery we suffered this night exceeded the preceding. The sea flew
over us with great force and kept us baling with horror and anxiety.

Saturday 23.

At dawn of day I found everyone in a most distressed condition, and I
began to fear that another such night would put an end to the lives of
several who seemed no longer able to support their sufferings. I served
an allowance of two teaspoonfuls of rum, after drinking which, having
wrung our clothes and taken our breakfast of bread and water, we became a
little refreshed.

Towards noon the weather became fair, but with very little abatement of
the gale and the sea remained equally high. With some difficulty I
observed the latitude to be 13 degrees 44 minutes south: course since
yesterday noon north 74 degrees west, distance 116 miles; longitude made
31 degrees 32 minutes west from Tofoa.

The wind moderated in the evening and the weather looked much better,
which rejoiced all hands so that they ate their scanty allowance with
more satisfaction than for some time past. The night also was fair but,
being always wet with the sea, we suffered much from the cold.

Sunday 24.

A fine morning, I had the pleasure to see, produced some cheerful
countenances and, the first time for 15 days past, we experienced comfort
from the warmth of the sun. We stripped and hung our clothes up to dry,
which were by this time become so threadbare that they would not keep out
either wet or cold.

At noon I observed in latitude 13 degrees 33 minutes south; longitude by
account from Tofoa 33 degrees 28 minutes west; course north 84 degrees
west, distance 114 miles. With the usual allowance of bread and water for
dinner I served an ounce of pork to each person. This afternoon we had
many birds about us which are never seen far from land, such as boobies
and noddies.

ALLOWANCE LESSENED.

As the sea began to run fair, and we shipped but little water, I took the
opportunity to examine into the state of our bread and found that,
according to the present mode of issuing, there was a sufficient quantity
remaining for 29 days allowance, by which time I hoped we should be able
to reach Timor. But as this was very uncertain and it was possible that,
after all, we might be obliged to go to Java, I determined to proportion
the allowance so as to make our stock hold out six weeks. I was
apprehensive that this would be ill received, and that it would require
my utmost resolution to enforce it for, small as the quantity was which I
intended to take away for our future good, yet it might appear to my
people like robbing them of life, and some, who were less patient than
their companions, I expected would very ill brook it. However on my
representing the necessity of guarding against delays that might be
occasioned in our voyage by contrary winds, or other causes, and
promising to enlarge upon the allowance as we got on, they cheerfully
agreed to my proposal. It was accordingly settled that every person
should receive one 25th of a pound of bread for breakfast, and the same
quantity for dinner, so that by omitting the proportion for supper, we
had 43 days allowance.

Monday 25.

At noon some noddies came so near to us that one of them was caught by
hand. This bird was about the size of a small pigeon. I divided it with
its entrails into 18 portions, and by a well-known method at sea of Who
shall have this?* it was distributed with the allowance of bread and
water for dinner, and ate up bones and all, with salt water for sauce. I
observed the latitude 13 degrees 32 minutes south; longitude made 35
degrees 19 minutes west; course north 89 degrees west, distance 108
miles.

(*Footnote. One person turns his back on the object that is to be
divided: another then points separately to the portions, and each of them
asking aloud, "Who shall have this?" to which the first answers by naming
somebody. This impartial method of division gives every man an equal
chance of the best share.)

In the evening several boobies flying very near to us we had the good
fortune to catch one of them. This bird is as large as a duck: like the
noddy it has received its name from seamen for suffering itself to be
caught on the masts and yards of ships. They are the most presumptive
proofs of being in the neighbourhood of land of any seafowl we are
acquainted with. I directed the bird to be killed for supper, and the
blood to be given to three of the people who were the most distressed for
want of food. The body, with the entrails, beak, and feet, I divided into
18 shares, and with an allowance of bread, which I made a merit of
granting, we made a good supper, compared with our usual fare.

Tuesday 26.

Fresh breezes from the south-east with fine weather. In the morning we
caught another booby so that Providence appeared to be relieving our
wants in an extraordinary manner. Towards noon we passed a great many
pieces of the branches of trees, some of which appeared to have been no
long time in the water. I had a good observation for the latitude, and
found our situation to be in 13 degrees 41 minutes south; longitude by
account from Tofoa 37 degrees 13 minutes west; course south 85 degrees
west, 112 miles. The people were overjoyed at the addition to their
dinner which was distributed in the same manner as on the preceding
evening, giving the blood to those who were the most in want of food.

To make the bread a little savoury most of the people frequently dipped
it in salt water; but I generally broke mine into small pieces and ate it
in my allowance of water, out of a coconut shell with a spoon,
economically avoiding to take too large a piece at a time, so that I was
as long at dinner as if it had been a much more plentiful meal.

The weather was now serene, which nevertheless was not without its
inconveniences, for we began to feel distress of a different kind from
that which we had lately been accustomed to suffer. The heat of the sun
was so powerful that several of the people were seized with a languor and
faintness which made life indifferent. We were so fortunate as to catch
two boobies in the evening: their stomachs contained several flying-fish
and small cuttlefish, all of which I saved to be divided for dinner the
next day.

Wednesday 27.

A fresh breeze at east-south-east with fair weather. We passed much
driftwood this forenoon and saw many birds; I therefore did not hesitate
to pronounce that we were near the reefs of New Holland. From my
recollection of Captain Cook's survey of this coast I considered the
direction of it to be north-west, and I was therefore satisfied that,
with the wind to the southward of east, I could always clear any dangers.

At noon I observed in latitude 13 degrees 26 minutes south; course since
yesterday north 82 degrees west, distance 109 miles; longitude made 39
degrees 4 minutes. After writing my account I divided the two birds with
their entrails and the contents of their maws into 18 portions and, as
the prize was a very valuable one it was divided as before, by calling
out Who shall have this? so that today, with the allowance of a 25th of a
pound of bread at breakfast, and another at dinner, with the proportion
of water, I was happy to see that every person thought he had feasted.

In the evening we saw a gannet; and the clouds remained so fixed in the
west that I had little doubt of our being near the land. The people,
after taking their allowance of water for supper, amused themselves with
conversing on the probability of what we should find.

Thursday 28.

At one in the morning the person at the helm heard the sound of breakers,
and I no sooner lifted up my head than I saw them close under our lee,
not more than a quarter of a mile distant from us. I immediately hauled
on a wind to the north-north-east and in ten minutes time we could
neither see nor hear them.

I have already mentioned my reason for making New Holland so far to the
southward: for I never doubted of numerous openings in the reef through
which I could have access to the shore and, knowing the inclination of
the coast to be to the north-west and the wind mostly to the southward of
east, I could with ease range such a barrier of reefs till I should find
a passage, which now became absolutely necessary, without a moment's loss
of time. The idea of getting into smooth water and finding refreshments
kept my people's spirits up: their joy was very great after we had got
clear of the breakers to which we had approached much nearer than I
thought was possible, without first discovering them.

Friday 29.

In the morning at daylight, we could see nothing of the land or of the
reefs. We bore away again and at nine o'clock saw the reefs. The sea
broke furiously over every part, and we had no sooner got near to them
than the wind came at east, so that we could only lie along the line of
the breakers, within which we saw the water so smooth that every person
already anticipated the heart-felt satisfaction he should receive as soon
as we could get within them. I now found we were embayed for we could not
lie clear with the sails, the wind having backed against us; and the sea
set in so heavy towards the reef that our situation was become unsafe. We
could effect but little with the oars, having scarce strength to pull
them, and I began to apprehend that we should be obliged to attempt
pushing over the reef. Even this I did not despair of effecting with
success when happily we discovered a break in the reef, about one mile
from us, and at the same time an island of a moderate height within it,
nearly in the same direction, bearing west half north. I entered the
passage with a strong stream running to the westward and found it about a
quarter of a mile broad, with every appearance of deep water.

On the outside the reef inclined to the north-east for a few miles, and
from thence to the north-west: on the south side of the entrance it
inclined to the south-south-west as far as I could see it, and I
conjecture that a similar passage to this which we now entered may be
found near the breakers that I first discovered which are 23 miles south
of this channel.

I did not recollect what latitude Providential channel* lies in, but I
considered it to be within a few miles of this, which is situate in 12
degrees 51 minutes south latitude.

(*Footnote. Providential Channel is laid down by Captain Cook in 12
degrees 34 minutes south, longitude 143 degrees 33 minutes east.)

Being now happily within the reefs and in smooth water I endeavoured to
keep near them to try for fish, but the tide set us to the north-west, I
therefore bore away in that direction and, having promised to land on the
first convenient spot we could find, all our past hardships seemed
already to be forgotten.

At noon I had a good observation by which our latitude was 12 degrees 46
minutes south, whence the foregoing situations may be considered as
determined with some exactness. The island first seen bore
west-south-west five leagues. This, which I have called the island
Direction, will in fair weather always show the channel, from which it
bears due west, and may be seen as soon as the reefs from a ship's
masthead: it lies in the latitude of 12 degrees 51 minutes south. These
however are marks too small for a ship to hit unless it can hereafter be
ascertained that passages through the reef are numerous along the coast
which I am inclined to think they are, in which case there would be
little risk even if the wind was directly on the shore.

My longitude made by dead reckoning from the island Tofoa to our passage
through the reef is 40 degrees 10 minutes west. Providential channel, I
imagine, must lie very nearly under the same meridian with our passage,
by which it appears we had out-run our reckoning 1 degree 9 minutes.

We now returned God thanks for his gracious protection, and with much
content took our miserable allowance of a 25th of a pound of bread and a
quarter of a pint of water for dinner.


CHAPTER 16.

Progress to the Northward along the Coast of New Holland.
Land on different Islands in search of Supplies.

May 1789.

As we advanced within the reefs the coast began to show itself very
distinctly in a variety of high and low land, some parts of which were
covered with wood. In our way towards the shore we fell in with a point
of a reef which is connected with that towards the sea, and here we came
to a grapnel and tried to catch fish but had no success. The island
Direction at this time bore south three or four leagues. Two islands lay
about four miles to the west by north, and appeared eligible for a
resting-place, if for nothing more; but on our approach to the nearest
island it proved to be only a heap of stones, and its size too
inconsiderable to shelter the boat. We therefore proceeded to the next,
which was close to it and towards the main. On the north-west side of
this I found a bay and a fine sandy point to land at. Our distance was
about a quarter of a mile from a projecting part of the main, which bore
from south-west by south to north-north-west three-quarters west. We
landed to examine if there were any signs of the natives being near us:
we saw some old fireplaces but nothing to make me apprehend that this
would be an unsafe situation for the night. Everyone was anxious to find
something to eat, and it was soon discovered that there were oysters on
the rocks for the tide was out; but it was nearly dark and only a few
could be gathered. I determined therefore to wait till the morning, when
I should better know how to proceed, and I directed that one half of our
company should sleep on shore and the other half in the boat. We would
gladly have made a fire but, as we could not accomplish it, we took our
rest for the night, which happily was calm and undisturbed.

Friday 29.

The dawn of day brought greater strength and spirits to us than I
expected for, notwithstanding everyone was very weak, there appeared
strength sufficient remaining to make me conceive the most favourable
hopes of our being able to surmount the difficulties we might yet have to
encounter.

As there were no appearances to make me imagine that any of the natives
were near us I sent out parties in search of supplies, while others of
the people were putting the boat in order that we might be ready to go to
sea, in case any unforeseen cause should make it necessary. One of the
gudgeons of the rudder had come out in the course of the night and was
lost. This, if it had happened at sea, might have been attended with the
most serious consequences, as the management of the boat could not have
been so nicely preserved as these very heavy seas required. I had been
apprehensive of this accident, and had in some measure prepared for it,
by having grummets fixed on each quarter of the boat for oars; but our
utmost readiness in using them would not probably have saved us. It
appears therefore a providential circumstance that it happened in a place
of safety, and that it was in our power to remedy the defect; for by
great good luck we found a large staple in the boat, which answered the
purpose.

The parties returned, highly rejoiced at having found plenty of oysters
and fresh water. I had also made a fire by the help of a small magnifying
glass and, what was still more fortunate, we found among the few things
which had been thrown into the boat and saved a piece of brimstone and a
tinderbox, so that I secured fire for the future.

One of the people had been so provident as to bring away with him from
the ship a copper pot: by being in possession of this article we were
enabled to make a proper use of the supply we now obtained for, with a
mixture of bread and a little pork, we made a stew that might have been
relished by people of far more delicate appetites, and of which each
person received a full pint.

The general complaints of disease among us were a dizziness in the head,
great weakness of the joints, and violent tenesmus, most of us having had
no evacuation by stool since we left the ship. I had constantly a severe
pain at my stomach but none of our complaints were alarming: on the
contrary, everyone retained marks of strength that, with a mind possessed
of a tolerable share of fortitude, seemed able to bear more fatigue than
I imagined we should have to undergo in our voyage to Timor.

As I would not allow the people to expose themselves to the heat of the
sun, it being near noon, everyone took his allotment of earth where it
was shaded by the bushes for a short sleep.

The oysters which we found grew so fast to the rocks that it was with
difficulty they could be broken off, and at length we discovered it to be
the most expeditious way to open them where they were fixed. They were of
a good size, and well tasted. To add to this happy circumstance in the
hollow of the land there grew some wire-grass, which indicated a moist
situation. On forcing a stick, about three feet long, into the ground we
found water, and with little trouble dug a well which produced as much as
our occasions required. It was very good, but I could not determine if it
was a spring or not. We were not obliged to make the well deep for it
flowed as fast as we emptied it, which, as the soil was apparently too
loose to retain water from the rains, renders it probable to be a spring.
On the south side of the island likewise we found a small run of good
water.

Besides places where fires had been made there were other signs of the
natives sometimes resorting to this island. I saw two ill-constructed
huts or wigwams which had only one side loosely covered, and a pointed
stick was found, about three feet long, with a slit in the end of it to
sling stones with, the same as the natives of Van Diemen's land use.

The track of some animal was very discernible and Nelson agreed with me
that it was the kangaroo; but whether these animals swim over from the
mainland, or are brought here by the natives to breed, it is impossible
to determine. The latter is not improbable as they may be taken with less
difficulty in a confined spot like this than on the continent.

The island is about a league in circuit: it is a high lump of rocks and
stones covered with wood; but the trees are small, the soil, which is
very indifferent and sandy, being barely sufficient to produce them. The
trees that came within our knowledge were the manchineal and a species of
purow; also some palm trees, the tops of which we cut down, and the soft
interior part or heart of them was so palatable that it made a good
addition to our mess. Nelson discovered some fern-roots which I thought
might be good roasted as a substitute for bread, but in this I was
mistaken: it however was very serviceable in its natural state to allay
thirst, and on that account I directed a quantity to be collected to take
into the boat. Many pieces of coconut shells and husk were found about
the shore, but we could find no coconut trees, neither did I see any on
the main.

I had cautioned the people not to touch any kind of berry or fruit that
they might find; yet they were no sooner out of my sight than they began
to make free with three different kinds that grew all over the island,
eating without any reserve. The symptoms of having eaten too much began
at last to frighten some of them but, on questioning others who had taken
a more moderate allowance, their minds were a little quieted. The others
however became equally alarmed in their turn, dreading that such symptoms
would come on, and that they were all poisoned, so that they regarded
each other with the strongest marks of apprehension, uncertain what would
be the issue of their imprudence. Fortunately the fruit proved wholesome
and good. One sort grew on a small delicate kind of vine; they were the
size of a large gooseberry and very like in substance, but had only a
sweet taste; the skin was a pale red, streaked with yellow the long way
of the fruit: it was pleasant and agreeable. Another kind grew on bushes
like that which is called the seaside grape in the West Indies, but the
fruit was very different, being more like elderberries, and grew in
clusters in the same manner. The third sort was a blackberry; this was
not in such plenty as the others and resembled a bullace, or large kind
of sloe, both in size and taste. When I saw that these fruits were eaten
by the birds I no longer doubted of their being wholesome, and those who
had already tried the experiment, not finding any bad effect, made it a
certainty that we might eat of them without danger.

Wild pigeons, parrots, and other birds were about the summit of the
island but, having no firearms, relief of that kind was not to be
expected unless we should find some unfrequented spot where the birds
were so tame that we might take them with our hands.

The shore of this island is very rocky except the place at which we
landed, and here I picked up many pieces of pumice-stone. On the part of
the main nearest to us were several sandy bays which at low water became
an extensive rocky flat. The country had rather a barren appearance
except in a few places where it was covered with wood. A remarkable range
of rocks lay a few miles to the south-west, and a high peaked hill seemed
to terminate the coast towards the sea, with islands to the southward. A
high fair cape showed the direction of the coast to the north-west about
seven leagues distant; and two small isles lay three or four leagues to
the northward of our present station.

I saw a few bees or wasps and several lizards; and the blackberry bushes
were full of ants nests, webbed like a spider's but so close and compact
as not to admit the rain. A trunk of a tree about 50 feet long lay on the
beach, from which I conclude that a heavy sea sets in here with a
northerly wind.

This day being the anniversary of the restoration of King Charles the
Second, and the name not being inapplicable to our present situation (for
we were restored to fresh life and strength) I named this Restoration
Island; for I thought it probable that Captain Cook might not have taken
notice of it. The other names which I have presumed to give the different
parts of the coast are meant only to show my route more distinctly.

At noon I observed the latitude of the island to be 12 degrees 39 minutes
south, our course having been north 66 degrees west, distance 18 miles
from yesterday noon. The wind was at east-south-east with very fine
weather.

In the afternoon I sent parties out again to gather oysters, with which
and some of the inner part of the palm-top we made another good stew for
supper, each person receiving a full pint and a half; but I refused bread
to this meal for I considered that our wants might yet be very great, and
was intent on saving our principal support whenever it was in my power.
After supper we again divided and those who were on shore slept by a good
fire.

Saturday 30.

In the morning I discovered a visible alteration in our company for the
better, and I sent them away again to gather oysters. We had now only two
pounds of pork left. This article, which I could not keep under lock and
key as I did the bread, had been pilfered by some inconsiderate person,
but everyone denied having any knowledge of this act; I therefore
resolved to put it out of their power for the future by sharing what
remained for our dinner. While the party was out picking up oysters I got
the boat in readiness for sea, and filled all our water vessels, which
amounted to nearly 60 gallons.

The party being returned, dinner was soon ready, which was as plentiful a
meal as the supper on the preceding evening, and with the pork I gave an
allowance of bread. As it was not yet noon I sent the people once more to
gather oysters for a sea store, recommending to them to be as diligent as
possible for that I was determined to sail in the afternoon.

At noon I again observed the latitude 12 degrees 39 minutes south; it was
then high-water, the tide had risen three feet, but I could not be
certain from whence the flood came. I deduce the time of high-water at
full and change to be ten minutes past seven in the morning.

Early in the afternoon the people returned with the few oysters that they
had collected and everything was put into the boat. I then examined the
quantity of bread remaining and found 38 days allowance, according to the
last mode of issuing a 25th of a pound at breakfast and at dinner.

Fair weather and moderate breezes at east-south-east and south-east.

Being ready for sea I directed every person to attend prayers. At four
o'clock we were preparing to embark when about twenty of the natives
appeared, running and hallooing to us, on the opposite shore. They were
each armed with a spear or lance and a short weapon which they carried in
their left hand: they made signs for us to come to them. On the top of
the hills we saw the heads of many more: whether these were their wives
and children or others who waited for our landing, meaning not to show
themselves lest we might be intimidated, I cannot say but, as I found we
were discovered to be on the coast, I thought it prudent to make the best
of our way for fear of being pursued by canoes, though, from the accounts
of Captain Cook, the chance was that there were very few if any of
consequence on any part of the coast. I passed these people as near as I
could with safety: they were naked and apparently black, and their hair
or wool bushy and short.

I directed my course within two small islands that lie to the north of
Restoration Island, passing between them and the mainland towards Fair
Cape with a strong tide in my favour, so that I was abreast of it by
eight o'clock. The coast we passed was high and woody. As I could see no
land without Fair Cape I concluded that the coast inclined to the
north-west and west-north-west: I therefore steered more towards the
west; but by eleven o'clock at night we met with low land which inclined
to the north-east, and at three o'clock in the morning I found that we
were embayed, which obliged us to stand back for a short time to the
southward.

Sunday 31.

At daybreak I was exceedingly surprised to find the appearance of the
country entirely changed, as if in the course of the night we had been
transported to another part of the world; for we had now a low sandy
coast in view, with very little verdure or anything to indicate that it
was at all habitable to a human being except a few patches of small trees
or brushwood.

Many small islands were in sight to the north-east about six miles
distant. The eastern part of the main bore north four miles, and Fair
Cape south-south-east five or six leagues. I took the channel between the
nearest island and the mainland, which were about one mile apart, leaving
all the islands on the starboard side. Some of these were very pretty
spots, covered with wood and well situated for fishing: large shoals of
fish were about us but we could not catch any. In passing this strait we
saw another party of Indians, seven in number, running towards us,
shouting and making signs for us to land. Some of them waved green
branches of the bushes which were near them as a token of friendship; but
some of their other motions were less friendly. A little farther off we
saw a larger party who likewise came towards us. I therefore determined
not to land though I much wished to have had some intercourse with these
people. Nevertheless I laid the boat close to the rocks and beckoned to
them to approach but none of them would come within 200 yards of us. They
were armed in the same manner as the people we had seen from Restoration
Island; they were stark naked, their colour black, with short bushy hair
or wool, and in their appearance were similar to them in every respect.
An island of a good height bore north half west four miles from us, at
which I resolved to land and from thence to take a look at the coast. At
this isle we arrived about eight o'clock in the morning. The shore was
rocky but the water was smooth and we landed without difficulty. I sent
two parties out, one to the northward and the other to the southward, to
seek for supplies, and others I ordered to stay by the boat. On this
occasion fatigue and weakness so far got the better of their sense of
duty that some of the people expressed their discontent at having worked
harder than their companions, and declared that they would rather be
without their dinner than go in search of it. One person in particular
went so far as to tell me, with a mutinous look, that he was as good a
man as myself. It was not possible for me to judge where this might have
an end if not stopped in time, therefore to prevent such disputes in
future I determined either to preserve my command or die in the attempt
and, seizing a cutlass, I ordered him to take hold of another and defend
himself, on which he called out that I was going to kill him and
immediately made concessions. I did not allow this to interfere further
with the harmony of the boat's crew and everything soon became quiet.

The parties continued collecting what they could find, which were some
fine oysters and clams and a few small dog-fish that were caught in the
holes of the rocks. We also found some rainwater in the hollow of the
rocks on the north part of the island, so that of this essential article
we were again so fortunate as to obtain a full supply.

After regulating the mode of proceeding I walked to the highest part of
the island to consider our route for the night. To my surprise no more of
the mainland could be seen here than from below, the northernmost part in
sight, which was full of sandhills bearing west by north about three
leagues. Except the isles to the east-south-east and south that we had
passed I could only discover a small key north-west by north. As this was
considerably farther from the main than the spot on which we were at
present I judged it would be a more secure resting-place for the night,
for here we were liable to an attack, if the Indians had canoes, as they
undoubtedly must have observed our landing. My mind being made up on this
point I returned after taking a particular look at the island we were on,
which I found only to produce a few bushes and some coarse grass, the
extent of the whole not being two miles in circuit. On the north side in
a sandy bay I saw an old canoe about 33 feet long, lying bottom upwards
and half buried in the beach. It was made of three pieces, the bottom
entire, to which the sides were sewed in the common way. It had a sharp
projecting prow rudely carved in resemblance of the head of a fish; the
extreme breadth was about three feet and I imagine it was capable of
carrying 20 men. The discovery of so large a canoe confirmed me in the
purpose of seeking a more retired place for our night's lodging.

At noon the parties were all returned but had found much difficulty in
gathering the oysters from their close adherence to the rocks, and the
clams were scarce: I therefore saw that it would be of little use to
remain longer in this place, as we should not be able to collect more
than we could eat. I named this Sunday Island: it lies north by west
three-quarters west from Restoration Island; the latitude by a good
observation 11 degrees 58 minutes south.

We had a fresh breeze at south-east by south with fair weather. At two
o'clock in the afternoon we dined, each person having a full pint and a
half of stewed oysters and clams, thickened with small beans which Nelson
informed me were a species of Dolichos. Having eaten heartily and
completed our water I waited to determine the time of high-water, which I
found to be at three o'clock, and the rise of the tide about five feet.
According to this it is high-water on the full and change at 19 minutes
past 9 in the morning: I observed the flood to come from the southward,
though at Restoration Island I thought it came from the northward. I
think Captain Cook mentions that he found great irregularity in the set
of the flood on this coast.

We steered for the key seen in the north-west by north where we arrived
just at dark, but found it so surrounded by a reef of rocks that I could
not land without danger of staving the boat; and on that account we came
to a grapnel for the night.

Monday June 1.

At dawn of day we got on shore and tracked the boat into shelter for, the
wind blowing fresh without and the ground being rocky, it was not safe to
trust her at a grapnel lest she should be blown to sea: I was therefore
obliged to let her ground in the course of the ebb. From appearances I
expected that if we remained till night we should meet with turtle as we
discovered recent tracks of them. Innumerable birds of a noddy kind made
this island their resting-place; so that we had reason to flatter
ourselves with hopes of getting supplies in greater abundance than it had
hitherto been in our power. Our situation was at least four leagues
distant from the main. We were on the north-westernmost of four small
keys which were surrounded by a reef of rocks connected by sandbanks
except between the two northernmost, and there likewise it was dry at low
water, the whole forming a lagoon island into which the tide flowed: at
this entrance I kept the boat.

As usual I sent parties away in search of supplies but, to our great
disappointment, we could only get a few clams and some dolichos: with
these and the oysters we had brought from Sunday Island I made up a mess
for dinner with the addition of a small quantity of bread.

Towards noon Nelson and some others who had been to the easternmost key
returned, but Nelson was in so weak a condition that he was obliged to be
supported by two men. His complaint was a violent heat in his bowels, a
loss of sight, much drought, and an inability to walk. This I found was
occasioned by his being unable to support the heat of the sun and that,
when he was fatigued and faint, instead of retiring into the shade to
rest he had continued to attempt more than his strength was equal to. I
was glad to find that he had no fever; and it was now that the little
wine which I had so carefully saved became of real use. I gave it in very
small quantities with some pieces of bread soaked in it; and he soon
began to recover. The boatswain and carpenter also were ill and
complained of headache and sickness of the stomach. Others who had not
had any evacuation by stool became shockingly distressed with the
tenesmus so that there were but few without complaints. An idea prevailed
that the sickness of the boatswain and carpenter was occasioned by eating
the dolichos. Myself however and some others who had taken the same food
felt no inconvenience; but the truth was that many of the people had
eaten a large quantity of them raw, and Nelson informed me that they were
constantly teasing him whenever a berry was found to know if it was good
to eat; so that it would not have been surprising if many of them had
been really poisoned.

Our dinner was not so well relished as at Sunday Island because we had
mixed the dolichos with our stew. The oysters and soup however were eaten
by everyone except Nelson whom I fed with a few small pieces of bread
soaked in half a glass of wine, and he continued to mend.

In my walk round the island I found several coconut shells, the remains
of an old wigwam, and the backs of two turtles, but no sign of any
quadruped. One of the people found three seafowl's eggs.

As is common on such spots the soil is little other than sand, yet it
produced small toa-trees and some others that we were not acquainted
with. There were fish in the lagoon, but we could not catch any. Our
wants therefore were not likely to be supplied here, not even with water
for our daily expense: nevertheless I determined to wait till the
morning, that we might try our success in the night for turtle and birds.
A quiet night's rest also, I conceived, would be of essential service to
those who were unwell.

The wigwam and turtle shell were proofs that the natives at times visited
this place, and that they had canoes the remains of the large canoe that
we saw at Sunday Island left no room to doubt: but I did not apprehend
that we ran any risk by remaining here a short time. I directed our fire
however to be made in the thicket that we might not be discovered by its
light.

At noon I observed the latitude of this island to be 11 degrees 47
minutes south. The mainland extended towards the north-west and was full
of white sandhills: another small island lay within us, bearing west by
north one quarter north three leagues distant. Our situation being very
low we could see nothing of the reef towards the sea.

The afternoon was advantageously spent in sleep. There were however a few
not disposed to it, and those were employed in dressing some clams to
take with us for the next day's dinner: others we cut up in slices to
dry, which I knew was the most valuable supply we could find here, but
they were very scarce.

Towards evening I cautioned everyone against making too large a fire or
suffering it after dark to blaze up. Mr. Samuel and Mr. Peckover had
superintendence of this business, while I was strolling about the beach
to observe if I thought it could be seen from the main. I was just
satisfied that it could not when on a sudden the island appeared all in a
blaze that might have been discerned at a much more considerable
distance. I ran to learn the cause and found that it was occasioned by
the imprudence and obstinacy of one of the party who in my absence had
insisted on having a fire to himself, in making which the flames caught
the neighbouring grass and rapidly spread. This misconduct might have
produced very serious consequences by discovering our situation to the
natives for, if they had attacked us, we had neither arms nor strength to
oppose an enemy. Thus the relief which I expected from a little sleep was
totally lost and I anxiously waited for the flowing of the tide that we
might proceed to sea.

It was high-water at half-past five this evening whence I deduced the
time on the full and change of the moon to be 58 past 10 in the morning:
the rise was nearly five feet. I could not observe the set of the flood
but imagined it to come from the southward, and that I was mistaken at
Restoration Island as I found the time of high-water gradually later the
more we advanced to the northward.

At Restoration Island high-water full and change : 7 hours 10.
Sunday Island high-water full and change : 9 hours 19.
Here high-water full and change : 10 hours 58.

After eight o'clock Mr. Samuel and Mr. Peckover went out to watch for
turtle and three men went to the east key to endeavour to catch birds.
All the others, complaining of being sick, took their rest, except Mr.
Hayward and Mr. Elphinston whom I directed to keep watch. About midnight
the bird party returned with only twelve noddies, birds which I have
already described to be about the size of pigeons: but if it had not been
for the folly and obstinacy of one of the party, who separated from the
other two and disturbed the birds, they might have caught a great number.
I was so much provoked at my plans being thus defeated that I gave this
offender a good beating.* I now went in search of the turtling party who
had taken great pains but without success. This did not surprise me as it
was not to be expected that turtle would come near us after the noise
which had been made at the beginning of the evening in extinguishing the
fire. I therefore desired them to come back, but they requested to stay a
little longer as they still hoped to find some before daylight: however
they returned by three o'clock without any reward for their labour.

(*Footnote. Robert Lamb. This man when he came to Java acknowledged he
had eaten nine birds raw after he separated from his two companions.)

Tuesday 2.

The birds we half dressed that they might keep the better: and these with
a few clams made the whole of the supply procured here. I tied a few gilt
buttons and some pieces of iron to a tree for any of the natives that
might come after us and, finding my invalids much better for their
night's rest, we embarked and departed by dawn of day. Wind at
south-east; course to the north by west.

When we had run two leagues to the northward the sea suddenly became
rough which, not having before experienced since we were within the
reefs, I concluded to be occasioned by an open channel to the ocean. Soon
afterwards we met with a large shoal on which were two sandy keys;
between these and two others, four miles to the west, I passed on to the
northward, the sea still continuing to be rough.

Towards noon I fell in with six other keys, most of which produced some
small trees and brushwood. These formed a pleasing contrast with the
mainland we had passed which was full of sandhills. The country continued
hilly and the northernmost land, the same we had seen from the lagoon
island, appeared like downs, sloping towards the sea. Nearly abreast of
us was a flat-topped hill which on account of its shape I called
Pudding-pan hill; and a little to the northward were two other hills
which we called the Paps; and here was a small tract of country without
sand, the eastern part of which forms a cape whence the coast inclines to
the north-west by north.

At noon I observed in the latitude of 11 degrees 18 minutes south the
cape bearing west distant ten miles. Five small keys bore from north-east
to south-east, the nearest of them about two miles distant, and a low
sandy key between us and the cape bore west distant four miles. My course
from the lagoon island had been north half west distant 30 miles.

I am sorry it was not in my power to obtain a sufficient knowledge of the
depth of water but in our situation nothing could be undertaken that
might have occasioned delay. It may however be understood that to the
best of my judgment from appearances a ship may pass wherever I have
omitted to represent danger.

I divided six birds and issued one 25th of a pound of bread with half a
pint of water to each person for dinner, and I gave half a glass of wine
to Nelson, who was now so far recovered as to require no other
indulgence.

The gunner when he left the ship brought his watch with him, by which we
had regulated out time till today, when unfortunately it stopped; so that
noon, sunrise, and sunset, are the only parts of the 24 hours of which
from henceforward I can speak with certainty as to time.

The wind blew fresh from the south-south-east and south-east all the
afternoon with fair weather. As we stood to the north by west we found
more sea, which I attributed to our receiving less shelter from the reefs
to the eastward: it is probable they did not extend so far north as this;
at least it may be concluded that there is not a continued barrier to
prevent shipping having access to the shore. I observed that the stream
set to the north-west, which I considered to be the flood. In some places
along the coast we saw patches of wood. At five o'clock, steering to the
north-west, we passed a large and fair inlet into which I imagine there
is a safe and commodious entrance; it lies in latitude 11 degrees south.
About three leagues to the northward of this is an island, at which we
arrived about sunset, and took shelter for the night under a sandy point
which was the only part we could land at. This being rather a wild
situation I thought it best to sleep in the boat: nevertheless I sent a
party away to see if anything could be got, but they returned without
success. They saw a great number of turtle bones and shells where the
natives had been feasting, and their last visit seemed to be of late
date. The island was covered with wood, but in other respects it was a
lump of rocks.

Wednesday 3.

We lay at a grapnel till daylight with a very fresh gale and cloudy
weather. The main bore from south-east by south to north-north-west half
west three leagues, and a mountainous island with a flat top, north by
west four or five leagues, between which and the mainland were several
other islands. The spot we were at, which I call Turtle Island, lies in
latitude by account 10 degrees 52 minutes south and 42 miles west from
Restoration Island. Abreast of it the coast has the appearance of a sandy
desert, but improves about three leagues farther to the northward where
it terminates in a point, near to which are many small islands. I sailed
between these islands where I found no bottom at twelve fathoms; the high
mountainous island with a flat top and four rocks to the south-east of
it, that I call the Brothers, being on my starboard hand. Soon after an
extensive opening appeared in the mainland, in which were a number of
high islands. I called this the Bay of Islands. We continued steering to
the north-west. Several islands and keys were in sight to the northward:
the most northerly island was mountainous, having on it a very high round
hill, and a smaller was remarkable for a single peaked hill.

The coast to the northward and westward of the Bay of Islands is high and
woody and has a broken appearance, with many islands close to it, among
which there are fine bays and convenient places for shipping. The
northernmost of these islands I call Wednesday Island: to the north-west
of this we fell in with a large reef which I believe joins a number of
keys that were in sight from the north-west to the east-north-east. We
therefore stood to the south-west half a league when it was noon, and I
had a good observation of the latitude in 10 degrees 31 minutes south.
Wednesday Island bore east by south five miles; the westernmost land in
sight south-west two or three leagues; the islands to the northward from
north-west by west to north-east, and the reef from west to north-east
distant one mile. I was now tolerably certain that we should be clear of
New Holland in the afternoon.

I know not how far this reef extends. It may be a continuation or a
detached part of the range of shoals that surround the coast. I believe
the mountainous islands to be separate from the shoals, and have no doubt
that near them may be found good passages for ships. But I rather
recommend to those who are to pass this strait from the eastward to take
their direction from the coast of New Guinea: yet I likewise think that a
ship coming from the southward will find a fair strait in the latitude of
10 degrees south. I much wished to have ascertained this point but in our
distressful situation any increase of fatigue or loss of time might have
been attended with the most fatal consequences. I therefore determined to
pass on without delay.

As an addition to our dinner of bread and water I served to each person
six oysters.

At two o'clock in the afternoon as we were steering to the south-west
towards the westernmost part of the land in sight we fell in with some
large sandbanks that run off from the coast: I therefore called this
Shoal Cape. We were obliged to steer to the northward again till we got
round the shoals, when I directed the course to the west.

At four o'clock the westernmost of the islands to the northward bore
north four leagues; Wednesday Island east by north five leagues, and
shoal cape south-east by east two leagues. A small island was seen
bearing west, at which we arrived before dark and found that it was only
a rock where boobies resort, for which reason I called it Booby Island.
Here terminated the rocks and shoals of the north part of New Holland for
except Booby Island no land was seen to the westward of south after three
o'clock this afternoon.

I find that Booby island was seen by Captain Cook and, by a remarkable
coincidence of ideas, received from him the same name, but I cannot with
certainty reconcile the situation of some parts of the coast that I have
seen to his survey. I ascribe this to the various forms in which land
appears when seen from the different heights of a ship and a boat. The
chart I have given is by no means meant to supersede that made by Captain
Cook, who had better opportunities than I had and was in every respect
properly provided for surveying. The intention of mine is chiefly to
render this narrative more intelligible, and to show in what manner the
coast appeared to me from an open boat. I have little doubt but that the
opening which I named the Bay of Islands is Endeavour Straits; and that
our track was to the northward of Prince of Wales' Isles. Perhaps, by
those who shall hereafter navigate these seas, more advantage may be
derived from the possession of both our charts than from either of them
singly.


CHAPTER 17.

Passage from New Holland to the Island Timor.
Arrive at Coupang.
Reception there.

June 1789.

Wednesday 3.

At eight o'clock in the evening we once more launched into the open
ocean. Miserable as our situation was in every respect I was secretly
surprised to see that it did not appear to affect anyone so strongly as
myself; on the contrary it seemed as if they had embarked on a voyage to
Timor in a vessel sufficiently calculated for safety and convenience. So
much confidence gave me great pleasure and I may venture to assert that
to this cause our preservation is chiefly to be attributed.

I encouraged everyone with hopes that eight or ten days would bring us to
a land of safety; and, after praying to God for a continuance of his most
gracious protection, I served an allowance of water for supper and
directed our course to the west-south-west to counteract the southerly
winds in case they should blow strong.

We had been just six days on the coast of New Holland in the course of
which we found oysters, a few clams, some birds, and water. But perhaps a
benefit nearly equal to this we received by having been relieved from the
fatigue of being constantly in the boat and enjoying good rest at night.
These advantages certainly preserved our lives and, small as the supply
was, I am very sensible how much it alleviated our distresses. By this
time nature must have sunk under the extremes of hunger and fatigue. Some
would have ceased to struggle for a life that only promised wretchedness
and misery; and others, though possessed of more bodily strength, must
soon have followed their unfortunate companions. Even in our present
situation we were most deplorable objects; but the hopes of a speedy
relief kept up our spirits. For my own part, incredible as it may appear,
I felt neither extreme hunger nor thirst. My allowance contented me,
knowing that I could have no more.

Thursday 4.

I served one 25th of a pound of bread and an allowance of water for
breakfast and the same for dinner with an addition of six oysters to each
person. At noon latitude observed 10 degrees 48 minutes south; course
since yesterday noon south 81 degrees west, distance 111 miles; longitude
by account from Shoal Cape 1 degree 45 minutes west. A strong tradewind
at east-south-east with fair weather.

This day we saw a number of water-snakes that were ringed yellow and
black, and towards noon we passed a great deal of rock-weed. Though the
weather was fair we were constantly shipping water, which kept two men
always employed to bale the boat.

Friday 5.

At noon I observed in latitude 10 degrees 45 minutes south; our course
since yesterday west one quarter north, 108 miles; longitude made 3
degrees 35 minutes west. Six oysters were, as yesterday, served to each
man, in addition to the usual allowance of bread and water.

In the evening a few boobies came about us, one of which I caught with my
hand. The blood was divided among three of the men who were weakest, but
the bird I ordered to be kept for our dinner the next day. Served a
quarter of a pint of water for supper, and to some who were most in need
half a pint. In the course of the night, being constantly wet with the
sea, we suffered much cold and shiverings.

Saturday 6.

At daylight I found that some of the clams which had been hung up to dry
for sea-store were stolen; but everyone solemnly denied having any
knowledge of it. This forenoon we saw a gannet, a sand-lark and some
water-snakes which in general were from two or three feet long.

The usual allowance of bread and water was served for breakfast, and the
same for dinner with the bird, which I distributed in the usual way, of
Who shall have this? I proposed to make Timor about the latitude of 9
degrees 30 minutes south, or 10 degrees south. At noon I observed the
latitude to be 10 degrees 19 minutes south; course north 77 degrees west,
distance 117 miles; longitude made from the Shoal Cape, the north part of
New Holland, 5 degrees 31 minutes west.

In the afternoon I took an opportunity of examining our store of bread,
and found remaining 19 days allowance, at the former rate of serving one
25th of a pound three times a day: therefore, as I saw every prospect of
a quick passage, I again ventured to grant an allowance for supper,
agreeable to my promise at the time it was discontinued.

Sunday 7.

We passed the night miserably wet and cold and in the morning I heard
heavy complaints. The sea was high and breaking over us. I could only
afford the allowance of bread and water for breakfast, but for dinner I
gave out an ounce of dried clams to each person, which was all that
remained.

At noon I altered the course to the west-north-west to keep more from the
sea, as the wind blew strong. Latitude observed 9 degrees 31 minutes
south; course north 57 degrees west, distance 88 miles; longitude made 6
degrees 46 minutes west.

The sea ran very high all this day and we had frequent showers of rain so
that we were continually wet and suffered much cold in the night. Mr.
Ledward the surgeon, and Lawrence Lebogue, an old hardy seaman, appeared
to be giving way very fast. I could only assist them by a teaspoonful or
two of wine which I had carefully saved, expecting such a melancholy
necessity.

Monday 8.

Wind at south-east. The weather was more moderate than it had been for
some days past. A few gannets were seen. At noon I observed in 8 degrees
45 minutes south; course west-north-west one quarter west, 106 miles;
longitude made 8 degrees 23 minutes west. The sea being smooth I steered
west by south.

At four in the afternoon we caught a small dolphin, which was the first
relief of the kind that we obtained. I issued about two ounces to each
person, including the offals, and saved the remainder for dinner the next
day. Towards evening the wind freshened and it blew strong all night, so
that we shipped much water and suffered greatly from the wet and cold.

Tuesday 9.

At daylight as usual I heard much complaining, which my own feelings
convinced me was too well founded. I gave the surgeon the Lebogue a
little wine but I could afford them no farther relief except encouraging
them with hopes that a very few days longer, at our present fine rate of
sailing, would bring us to Timor.

Gannets, boobies, men of war and tropic birds, were constantly about us.
Served the usual allowance of bread and water and at noon we dined on the
remains of the dolphin, which amounted to about an ounce per man. I
observed the latitude to be 9 degrees 9 minutes south; longitude made 10
degrees 8 minutes west; course since yesterday noon south 76 degrees
west; distance 107 miles.

This afternoon I suffered great sickness from the nature of part of the
stomach of the fish which had fallen to my share at dinner. At sunset
served an allowance of bread and water for supper.

Wednesday 10.

In the morning after a very comfortless night there was a visible
alteration for the worse in many of the people which gave me great
apprehensions. An extreme weakness, swelled legs, hollow and ghastly
countenances, a more than common inclination to sleep, with an apparent
debility of understanding, seemed to me the melancholy presages of an
approaching dissolution. The surgeon and Lebogue, in particular, were
most miserable objects. I occasionally gave them a few teaspoonfuls of
wine out of the little that remained, which greatly assisted them. The
hopes of being able to accomplish the voyage was our principal support.
The boatswain very innocently told me that he really thought I looked
worse than anyone in the boat. The simplicity with which he uttered such
an opinion amused me and I returned him a better compliment.

Our latitude at noon was 9 degrees 16 minutes south. Longitude from the
north part of New Holland 12 degrees 1 minute west. Course since
yesterday noon west half south 111 miles. Birds and rock-weed showed that
we were not far from land, but I expected such signs here as there are
many islands between the east part of Timor and New Guinea. The night was
more moderate than the last.

Thursday 11.

Everyone received the customary allowance of bread and water, and an
extra allowance of water was given to those who were most in need. At
noon I observed in latitude 9 degrees 41 minutes south; course 77 degrees
west, distance 109 miles; longitude made 13 degrees 49 minutes west. I
had little doubt of having now passed the meridian of the eastern part of
Timor which is laid down in 128 degrees east. This diffused universal joy
and satisfaction.

In the afternoon we saw gannets and many other birds, and at sunset we
kept a very anxious lookout. In the evening we caught a booby which I
reserved for our dinner the next day.

Friday 12.

At three in the morning, with an excess of joy, we discovered Timor
bearing from west-south-west to west-north-west, and I hauled on a wind
to the north-north-east till daylight, when the land bore from south-west
by south to north-east by north. Our distance from the shore two leagues.

It is not possible for me to describe the pleasure which the blessing of
the sight of this land diffused among us. It appeared scarce credible to
ourselves that, in an open boat and so poorly provided, we should have
been able to reach the coast of Timor in forty-one days after leaving
Tofoa, having in that time run, by our log, a distance of 3618 miles; and
that, notwithstanding our extreme distress, no one should have perished
in the voyage.

I have already mentioned that I knew not where the Dutch settlement was
situated but I had a faint idea that it was at the south-west part of the
island. I therefore, after daylight, bore away alongshore to the
south-south-west, which I was the more readily induced to do as the wind
would not suffer us to go towards the north-east without great loss of
time.

The day gave us a most agreeable prospect of the land which was
interspersed with woods and lawns; the interior part mountainous, but the
shore low. Towards noon the coast became higher with some remarkable
headlands. We were greatly delighted with the general look of the country
which exhibited many cultivated spots and beautiful situations; but we
could only see a few small huts whence I concluded that no European
resided in this part of the island. Much sea ran on the shore which made
landing impracticable. At noon we were abreast of a high headland; the
extremes of the land bore south-west half west, and north-north-east half
east; our distance offshore being three miles; latitude by observation 9
degrees 59 minutes south; and my longitude by dead reckoning from the
north part of New Holland 15 degrees 6 minutes west.

With the usual allowance of bread and water for dinner I divided the bird
we had caught the night before, and to the surgeon and Lebogue I gave a
little wine.

The wind blew fresh at east and east-south-east with very hazy weather.
During the afternoon we continued our course along a low shore covered
with innumerable palm-trees, called the Fan Palm from the leaf spreading
like a fan; but here we saw no signs of cultivation, nor had the country
so fine an appearance as to the eastward. This however was only a small
tract, for by sunset it improved again and I saw several great smokes
where the inhabitants were clearing and cultivating their grounds. We had
now run 25 miles to the west-south-west since noon and were west five
miles from a low point which, in the afternoon, I imagined had been the
southernmost land, and here the coast formed a deep bend with low land in
the bight that appeared like islands. The west shore was high; but from
this part of the coast to the high cape which we were abreast of at noon
the shore is low and I believe shoal. I particularly remark this
situation because here the very high ridge of mountains that run from the
east end of the island, terminate, and the appearance of the country
changes for the worse.

That we might not run past any settlement in the night I determined to
preserve my station till the morning and therefore brought to under a
close-reefed foresail. We were here in shoal water, our distance from the
shore being half a league, the westernmost land in sight bearing
west-south-west half west. Served bread and water for supper and, the
boat lying to very well, all but the officer of the watch endeavoured to
get a little sleep.

Saturday 13.

At two in the morning we wore and stood in shore till daylight when I
found we had drifted during the night about three leagues to the
west-south-west, the southernmost land in sight bearing west. On
examining the coast and not seeing any sign of a settlement we bore away
to the westward having a strong gale against a weather current which
occasioned much sea. The shore was high and covered with wood, but we did
not run far before low land again formed the coast, the points of which
opening at west I once more fancied we were on the south part of the
island; but at ten o'clock we found the coast again inclining towards the
south, part of it bearing west-south-west half west. At the same time
high land appeared in the south-west; but the weather was so hazy that it
was doubtful whether the two lands were separated, the opening only
extending one point of the compass. For this reason I stood towards the
outer land and found it to be the island Roti.

I returned to the shore we had left and brought to a grapnel in a sandy
bay that I might more conveniently calculate my situation. In this place
we saw several smokes where the natives were clearing their grounds.
During the little time we remained here the master and carpenter very
much importuned me to let them go in search of supplies; to which at
length I assented but, not finding any other person willing to be of
their party, they did not choose to quit the boat. I stopped here no
longer than for the purpose just mentioned,  and we continued steering
alongshore. We had a view of a beautiful-looking country as if formed by
art into lawns and parks. The coast is low and covered with woods in
which are innumerable fan palm-trees that look like coconut walks. The
interior part is high land but very different from the more eastern parts
of the island where it is exceedingly mountainous and to appearance the
soil better.

At noon the island Roti bore south-west by west seven leagues. I had no
observation for the latitude but by account we were in 10 degrees 12
minutes south; our course since yesterday noon being south 77 degrees
west 54 miles. The usual allowance of bread and water was served for
breakfast and dinner, and to the surgeon and Lebogue I continued to give
wine.

We had a strong breeze at east-south-east with hazy weather all the
afternoon. At two o'clock, having run through a very dangerous breaking
sea, the cause of which I attributed to be a strong tide setting to
windward, and shoal water, we discovered a spacious bay or sound with a
fair entrance about two or three miles wide. I now conceived hopes that
our voyage was nearly at an end as no place could appear more eligible
for shipping or more likely to be chosen for a European settlement: I
therefore came to a grapnel near the east side of the entrance in a small
sandy bay where we saw a hut, a dog, and some cattle, and I immediately
sent the boatswain and gunner away to the hut to discover the
inhabitants.

The south-west point of the entrance bore west half south three miles;
the south-east point south by west three-quarters of a mile; and the
island Roti from south by west one quarter west to south-west one quarter
west about five leagues.

While we lay here I found the ebb came from the northward, and before our
departure the falling of the tide discovered to us a reef of rocks about
two cables length from the shore, the whole being covered at high-water
renders it dangerous. On the opposite shore also appeared very high
breakers; but there is nevertheless plenty of room and certainly a safe
channel for a first-rate man of war.

The bay or sound within, seemed to be of a considerable extent, the
northern part being about five leagues distant. Here the land made in
moderate risings joined by lower grounds. But the island Roti to the
southward is the best mark by which to know this place.

I had just time to make these remarks when I saw the boatswain and gunner
returning with some of the natives: I therefore no longer doubted of our
success and that our expectations would be fully gratified. They brought
five Indians and informed me that they had found two families where the
women treated them with European politeness. From these people I learned
that the governor resided at a place called Coupang which was some
distance to the north-east. I made signs for one of them to go in the
boat and show us the way to Coupang, intimating that I would pay him for
his trouble: the man readily complied and came into the boat.

These people were of a dark tawny colour, had long black hair, and chewed
a great deal of betel. Their dress was a square piece of cloth round the
hips in the folds of which was stuck a large knife; a handkerchief
wrapped round the head, and another hanging by the four corners from the
shoulders, which served as a bag for their betel equipage. They brought
us a few pieces of dried turtle and some ears of Indian corn. This last
was the most welcome; for the turtle was so hard that it could not be
eaten without being first soaked in hot water. They offered to bring us
some other refreshments if I would wait, but as the pilot was willing I
determined to push on. It was about half an hour past four when we
sailed.

By direction of the pilot we kept close to the east shore under all our
sail; but as night came on the wind died away and we were obliged to try
at the oars which I was surprised to see we could use with some effect.
At ten o'clock, finding we advanced but slowly, I came to a grapnel and
for the first time I issued double allowance of bread and a little wine
to each person.

Sunday 14.

At one o'clock in the morning, after the most happy and sweet sleep that
ever men enjoyed, we weighed and continued to keep the east shore on
board in very smooth water; when at last I found we were again open to
the sea, the whole of the land to the westward that we had passed being
an island which the pilot called Pulo Samow. The northern entrance of
this channel is about a mile and a half or two miles wide and I had no
ground at ten fathoms.

The report of two cannon that were fired gave new life to everyone; and
soon after we discovered two square-rigged vessels and a cutter at anchor
to the eastward. We endeavoured to work to windward but were obliged to
take to our oars again, having lost ground on each tack. We kept close to
the shore and continued rowing till four o'clock when I brought to a
grapnel and gave another allowance of bread and wine to all hands. As
soon as we had rested a little we weighed again, and rowed till near
daylight when we came to a grapnel off a small fort and town which the
pilot told me was Coupang.

Among the things which the boatswain had thrown into the boat before we
left the ship was a bundle of signal flags that had been used by the
boats to show the depth of water in sounding; with these we had in the
course of the passage made a small jack which I now hoisted in the main
shrouds as a signal of distress, for I did not think proper to land
without leave.

Soon after daybreak a soldier hailed us to land, which I immediately did
among a crowd of Indians, and was agreeably surprised to meet with an
English sailor who belonged to one of the vessels in the road. His
captain he told me was the second person in the town; I therefore desired
to be conducted to him as I was informed the governor was ill and could
not then be spoken with.

Captain Spikerman received me with great humanity. I informed him of our
distressed situation; and requested that care might be taken of those who
were with me without delay. On which he gave directions for their
immediate reception at his own house, and went himself to the governor to
know at what time I could be permitted to see him, which was fixed to be
at eleven o'clock.

I now desired my people to come on shore which was as much as some of
them could do, being scarce able to walk: they however were helped to the
house and found tea with bread and butter provided for their breakfast.

The abilities of a painter, perhaps, could seldom have been displayed to
more advantage than in the delineation of the two groups of figures which
at this time presented themselves to each other. An indifferent spectator
would have been at a loss which most to admire, the eyes of famine
sparkling at immediate relief, or the horror of their preservers at the
sight of so many spectres, whose ghastly countenances, if the cause had
been unknown, would rather have excited terror than pity. Our bodies were
nothing but skin and bones, our limbs were full of sores, and we were
clothed in rags: in this condition, with the tears of joy and gratitude
flowing down our cheeks, the people of Timor beheld us with a mixture of
horror, surprise, and pity.

The governor, Mr. William Adrian van Este, notwithstanding extreme
ill-health, became so anxious about us that I saw him before the
appointed time. He received me with great affection and gave me the
fullest proofs that he was possessed of every feeling of a humane and
good man. Sorry as he was, he said, that such a calamity could ever have
happened to us, yet he considered it as the greatest blessing of his life
that we had fallen under his protection and, though his infirmity was so
great that he could not do the office of a friend himself, he would give
such orders as I might be certain would procure us every supply we
wanted. A house should be immediately prepared for me, and with respect
to my people he said that I might have room for them either at the
hospital or on board of captain Spikerman's ship which lay in the road;
and he expressed much uneasiness that Coupang could not afford them
better accommodations, the house assigned to me being the only one
uninhabited and the situation of the few families that lived at this
place such that they could not conveniently receive strangers. For the
present till matters could be properly regulated he gave directions that
victuals for my people should be dressed at his own house.

On returning to Captain Spikerman's house I found that every kind relief
had been given to my people. The surgeon had dressed their sores and the
cleaning of their persons had not been less attended to, several friendly
gifts of apparel having been presented to them.

I desired to be shown to the house that was intended for me, which I
found ready with servants to attend. It consisted of a hall, with a room
at each end, and a loft overhead; and was surrounded by a piazza with an
outer apartment in one corner and a communication from the back part of
the house to the street. I therefore determined, instead of separating
from my people, to lodge them all with me; and I divided the house as
follows: one room I took to myself, the other I allotted to the master,
surgeon, Mr. Nelson, and the gunner; the loft to the other officers, and
the outer apartment to the men. The hall was common to the officers and
the men had the back piazza. Of this disposition I informed the governor,
and he sent down chairs, tables and benches, with bedding and other
necessaries for the use of everyone.

The governor when I took my leave had desired me to acquaint him with
everything of which I stood in need; but it was only at particular times
that he had a few moments of ease, or could attend to anything, being in
a dying state with an incurable disease. On this account I transacted
whatever business I had with Mr. Timotheus Wanjon, the second of this
place, who was the governor's son-in-law, and who also contributed
everything in his power to make our situation comfortable. I had been,
therefore, misinformed by the seaman who told me that captain Spikerman
was the next person in command to the governor.

At noon a dinner was brought to the house sufficiently good to make
persons more accustomed to plenty eat too much. Yet I believe few in such
a situation would have observed more moderation than my people did. My
greatest apprehension was that they would eat too much fruit, of which
there was great variety in season at this time.

Having seen everyone enjoy this meal of plenty I dined myself with Mr.
Wanjon; but I felt no extraordinary inclination to eat or drink. Rest and
quiet I considered as more necessary to the reestablishment of my health
and therefore retired soon to my room which I found furnished with every
convenience. But instead of rest my mind was disposed to reflect on our
late sufferings, and on the failure of the expedition; but above all on
the thanks due to Almighty God who had given us power to support and bear
such heavy calamities and had enabled me at last to be the means of
saving eighteen lives.

In times of difficulty there will generally arise circumstances that bear
particularly hard on a commander. In our late situation it was not the
least of my distresses to be constantly assailed with the melancholy
demands of my people for an increase of allowance which it grieved me to
refuse. The necessity of observing the most rigid economy in the
distribution of our provisions was so evident that I resisted their
solicitations and never deviated from the agreement we made at setting
out. The consequence of this care was that at our arrival we had still
remaining sufficient for eleven days at our scanty allowance: and if we
had been so unfortunate as to have missed the Dutch settlement at Timor
we could have proceeded to Java where I was certain that every supply we
wanted could be procured.

Another disagreeable circumstance to which my situation exposed me was
the caprice of ignorant people. Had I been incapable of acting they would
have carried the boat on shore as soon as we made the island of Timor
without considering that landing among the natives at a distance from the
European settlement might have been as dangerous as among any other
Indians.

The quantity of provisions with which we left the ship was not more than
we should have consumed in five days had there been no necessity for
husbanding our stock. The mutineers must naturally have concluded that we
could have no other place of refuge than the Friendly Islands for it was
not likely they should imagine that, so poorly equipped as we were in
every respect, there could have been a possibility of our attempting to
return homewards: much less can they suspect that the account of their
villainy has already reached their native country.

When I reflect how providentially our lives were saved at Tofoa by the
Indians delaying their attack and that, with scarce anything to support
life, we crossed a sea of more than 1200 leagues, without shelter from
the inclemency of the weather; when I reflect that in an open boat with
so much stormy weather we escaped foundering, that not any of us were
taken off by disease, that we had the great good fortune to pass the
unfriendly natives of other countries without accident, and at last
happily to meet with the most friendly and best of people to relieve our
distresses; I say when I reflect on all these wonderful escapes the
remembrance of such great mercies enables me to bear, with resignation
and cheerfulness, the failure of an expedition the success of which I had
so much at heart and which was frustrated at a time when I was
congratulating myself on the fairest prospect of being able to complete
it in a manner that would fully have answered the intention of His
Majesty and the humane promoters of so benevolent a plan.

With respect to the preservation of our health during a course of 16 days
of heavy and almost continual rain I would recommend to everyone in a
similar situation the method we practised which is to dip their clothes
in the salt-water and wring them out as often as they become filled with
rain: it was the only resource we had, and I believe was of the greatest
service to us, for it felt more like a change of dry clothes than could
well be imagined. We had occasion to do this so often that at length all
our clothes were wrung to pieces: for, except the few days we passed on
the coast of New Holland, we were continually wet either with rain or
sea.

Thus through the assistance of Divine Providence we surmounted the
difficulties and distresses of a most perilous voyage and arrived safe in
an hospitable port where every necessary and comfort were administered to
us with a most liberal hand.


CHAPTER 18.

At Coupang.

JUNE 1789.

TIMOR.

From the great humanity and attention of the governor and the gentlemen
at Coupang we received every kind of assistance and were not long without
evident signs of returning health. Shortly after our arrival I presented
to the governor a formal account of the loss of the Bounty; and a
requisition in His Majesty's name that instructions might be sent to all
the Dutch settlements to stop the ship if she made her appearance. With
this a complete descriptive list of the mutineers was given.

I likewise requested in one of my first visits to the governor that
Nelson might have permission to walk about the country in search of
plants, which was readily granted with an offer of whatever assistance I
should think necessary: and the governor assured me that the country was
well worth examination as it abounded with many curious and medicinal
plants. From this indulgence I derived no benefit, for Nelson, who since
we left New Holland had been but in a weak condition, about this time was
taken ill in consequence of a cold caused by imprudently leaving off warm
clothing.

To secure our arrival at Batavia before the October fleet sailed for
Europe I gave public notice of my intention to hire a vessel to carry us
to Batavia. In consequence of this notice several offers were made but
none that I thought reasonable; which determined me to purchase a small
schooner in the road, that was 34 feet long, for which I gave 1000
rix-dollars and fitted her for sea under the name of His Majesty's
schooner Resource. As the coast of Java is frequently infested with small
piratical vessels it was necessary that we should be provided with the
proper means of defence. In this I was assisted by the friendship of Mr.
Wanjon who supplied me with four brass swivels, 14 stand of small arms,
and ammunition, which he obligingly let me have as a loan to be returned
at Batavia.

July 20.

On the 20th of July I had the misfortune to lose Mr. David Nelson: he
died of an inflammatory fever. The loss of this honest man I very much
lamented: he had with great care and diligence attended to the object for
which he was sent, and had always been ready to forward every plan that
was proposed, for the good of the service in which we were engaged. He
was not less useful in our voyage hither, in the course of which he gave
me great satisfaction, by the patience and fortitude with which he
conducted himself.

July 21.

This day I was employed attending the funeral of Mr. Nelson. The corpse
was carried by twelve soldiers dressed in black preceded by the minister;
next followed myself and the second governor; then ten gentlemen of the
town and the officers of the ships in the harbour; and after them my own
officers and people.

After reading our burial-service the body was interred behind the chapel,
in the burying-ground appropriated to the Europeans of the town. I was
sorry I could get no tombstone to place over his remains.

This was the second voyage Mr. Nelson had undertaken to the South Seas,
having been sent out by Sir Joseph Banks to collect plants, seeds, etc.
in Captain Cook's last voyage. And now, after surmounting so many
difficulties, and in the midst of thankfulness for his deliverance, he
was called upon to pay the debt of nature at a time least expected.

August 20.

Our schooner being victualled and ready for sea, on the 20th of August I
took an affectionate leave of the hospitable and friendly inhabitants of
Coupang and embarked. In the afternoon we sailed, having the launch which
had so much contributed to our preservation in tow. We exchanged salutes
with the fort and shipping as we ran out of the harbour.

The town of Coupang is situated in a great bay which is an excellent road
for shipping. The latitude of the town is 10 degrees 12 minutes south.
According to the Dutch charts it is in 121 degrees 51 minutes east
longitude. Taking the mean between the longitude by my reckoning on our
arrival at Coupang, and the longitude afterwards calculated from our run
to Batavia, gives me for the longitude of Coupang 124 degrees 41 minutes
east.

This settlement was formed in the year 1630 and is the only one the Dutch
have on the island Timor. They have residents in different parts of the
country. On the north side of Timor there is a Portuguese settlement. The
produce of the island is chiefly sandalwood and beeswax: the former
article is now scarce. Wax they have in great plenty. The bees build
their nests in bushes and in the boughs of trees to which the natives
cannot approach but with fire. The honey is put into jars and the wax is
run into blocks of three feet in length and from 12 to 15 inches square.
The natives, at least those who live in the neighbourhood of Coupang, are
of a very indolent disposition, of which the Chinese have taken
advantage, for, though the Malays are very fond of traffic, most of their
trade is carried on in small Chinese vessels of from 10 to 30 tons
burden. There is a market at Coupang for the country people in which
however there is little business done. I have seen a man from the country
come to market with two potatoes: and this is not unusual. These being
sold for two doits (equal to a halfpenny English) serve to supply him
with betel to chew; and the remainder of the day is passed in lounging
about the town. The inland people, who live at a distance from the
Europeans, are strong and active, but their want of cleanliness subjects
them to filthy diseases.

The chief of the natives, or king of the island, is by the Dutch styled
Keyfer (Emperor). This prince lives at a place called Backennassy, about
four miles distant from Coupang. His authority over the natives is not
wholly undisputed; which is by the Dutch attributed to the intrigues of
the Portuguese, who are on the north part of Timor. The island has lately
suffered much by a competition between the present king and one of his
nephews, which caused a civil war that lasted from the beginning of the
year 1786 to 1788, when their differences were settled by a treaty,
chiefly in favour of the king. The ravages committed in these disputes
have occasioned a scarcity of provisions that probably, from the want of
industry in the natives, will not soon be remedied. I had an opportunity
of making a visit to the king. His dwelling was a large house which was
divided into only three apartments and surrounded by a piazza, agreeably
situated but very dirty, as was all the furniture. The king, who is an
elderly man, received me with much civility and ordered refreshments to
be set before me, which were tea, rice cakes, roasted Indian corn, and
dried buffalo flesh, with about a pint of arrack, which I believe was all
he had. His dress was a check wrapper girded round his waist with a silk
and gold belt, a loose linen jacket, and a coarse handkerchief about his
head. A few of his chiefs were with him who partook of our repast; after
which the king retired with three of them for a short time and when he
returned presented me with a round plate of metal about four inches
diameter on which was stamped the figure of a star. As I had been
informed that arrack would be an acceptable present I was prepared to
make a return which was well received. They never dilute their liquor and
from habit are able to drink a large quantity of spirits at a time
without being intoxicated.

When a king dies a large feast is made to which all the inhabitants are
invited. The body after a few days is put into a coffin which is closed
up and kept three years before it is interred.

The Dutch have been at some pains to establish Christianity among the
natives: but it has not gained much ground, except in the neighbourhood
of Coupang. The present king was christened by the name of Barnardus. His
Indian name is Bachee Bannock. The scriptures are translated into the
Malay language and prayers are performed in the church at Coupang by a
Malay clergyman, in that language.

I met at Timor with most of the fruits that are described in Captain
Cook's first voyage as natives of Batavia, except the mangosteen. The
breadfruit tree, called by the Malays soccoom, likewise grows here with
great luxuriance and appears to be as much a native of this island as it
is of Otaheite. The fruit is exactly of the same kind but not so good. A
breadfruit of Timor weighs half as much more as one of equal size at
Otaheite. It is not used here as bread but generally eaten with milk and
sugar. At Backennassy I saw about twenty of the trees, larger than any I
have seen at Otaheite. Here is also a sort of breadfruit tree that
produces seeds not unlike Windsor beans and equally palatable either
boiled or roasted. No other part of the fruit is eatable and, though the
tree I am told is to all appearance the same as the other, the fruits
have but little resemblance, the fruit of this being covered with
projecting points nearly half an inch in length.

I received a present of some fine plants from the governor, which I was
afterwards unfortunately obliged to leave at Batavia for want of proper
room to take care of them in the packet by which I returned to Europe.
Mr. Wanjon likewise favoured me with some seeds for His Majesty's garden
at Kew which I had the good fortune to deliver safe on my return: and
some of the mountain rice cultivated at Timor on the dry land, which was
forwarded to His Majesty's botanic garden at St. Vincent, and to other
parts in the West Indies.

A resemblance of language between the people of the South Sea islands and
the inhabitants of many of the islands in the East Indies has been
remarked in Captain Cook's first voyage. Here the resemblance appeared
stronger than has yet been noticed; particularly in their numerals. But
besides the language I observed some customs among the people of Timor
still more striking for their similarity. They practise the tooge-tooge*
of the Friendly Islands which they call toombock: and the roomee of
Otaheite which they call ramas. I likewise saw, placed on their graves,
offerings of baskets with tobacco and betel.

(*Footnote. The tooge-tooge is described in Captain Cook's last voyage
Volume 1 page 323; and the roomee in the same voyage Volume 2 page 64.)

I left the governor Mr. van Este at the point of death. To this gentleman
our most grateful thanks are due for the humane and friendly treatment
that we received from him. His ill state of health only prevented him
from showing us more particular marks of attention. Unhappily it is to
his memory only that I now pay this tribute. It was a fortunate
circumstance for us that Mr. Wanjon, the next in place to the governor,
was equally humane and ready to relieve us. His attention was unremitting
and, when there was a doubt about supplying me with money to enable me to
purchase a vessel, he cheerfully took it upon himself; without which it
was evident, I should have been too late at Batavia to have sailed for
Europe with the October fleet. I can only return such services by ever
retaining a grateful remembrance of them.

Mr. Max the town surgeon likewise behaved to us with the most
disinterested humanity: he attended everyone with the utmost care, for
which I could not prevail on him to receive any payment, or to render me
any account, or other answer than that it was his duty.


CHAPTER 19.

From Timor to Batavia.

AUGUST 1789.

Thursday 20.

From Coupang we steered north-west by west having a moderate breeze at
south-east with fair weather.

Saturday 22.

At daylight we saw the island Flores to the northward. At noon latitude
observed 9 degrees 27 minutes south, and longitude by account from
Coupang 2 degrees 10 minutes west. Our distance from the coast of Flores
was about 10 leagues; and two high peaked mountains bore north half east
and north-north-west. These two mountains resemble each other in shape
and the westernmost is a volcano. The interior parts of Flores are
mountainous and woody: but near the sea-coast is a fine open country. A
Dutch map with which I was provided places the south part of Flores in 9
degrees 3 minutes south which I am of opinion is too far south. We
steered along the south side of Flores, mostly with light winds and hazy
weather, so that we did not constantly keep sight of the coast.

Tuesday 25.

At noon we were off Toorns island which bore north-west by north three or
four leagues distant. Our latitude observed was 8 degrees 57 minutes
south and longitude made by dead reckoning from Coupang 3 degrees 27
minutes west. Toorns island is about four leagues in circuit and has a
craggy and uneven appearance. There is a curious high peak on the
south-west part: the land near the shore is low and woody.

Thursday 27.

On the 27th at noon we were near the entrance of the Straits of Mangaryn,
which not appearing so open and clear as represented in the map, I
steered for the straits of Sapi, intending to pass through; but was
obliged to give up this plan by strong currents setting to the south-east
which there was not sufficient wind to enable us to stem.

Saturday 29.

I therefore again stood for the Straits of Mangaryn which we ran through
in the afternoon of the 29th, being favoured with a fresh breeze from the
south-south-east. On our first entering the straits we got close to the
Flores shore: our course through was north half east. We tried for
soundings but could not anywhere find bottom at 25 and 30 fathoms depth.
On the Flores side there are many good harbours and bays where vessels
may anchor; but the country hereabouts appears burnt up and desolate.

I had no azimuth-compass and consequently could not observe very
accurately the variation; but I believe there is so little in Mangaryn
Straits that no great error will be occasioned by considering the true
and magnetic bearings to be the same.

When we had passed the straits we kept to the westward, running along the
north side of the island Sumbawa, where there is a very high mountain
near the coast, at the foot of which I am informed, are many runs of good
water, conveniently situated for ships to supply themselves. The latitude
of the north part of Sumbawa I make by my observations and bearings to be
8 degrees 6 minutes south, which differs very little from the Dutch
charts.

Monday 31.

In the night of the 31st several prows were rowing about us, on which
account we kept all night under arms.

September. Thursday 3.

This and the two following days we were sailing along the north side of
the island Lombok, on which is a high mountain. Most of the islands in
this route are distinguished by high mountains. Lombok appears to be well
clothed with wood. In the nights we saw fires upon the high lands at a
distance from the coast.

Sunday 6.

In the afternoon we saw the high land of Cape Sandana, which is the
north-east part of Java.

Monday 7.

The next day we were off cape Sandana which is a low cape projecting from
the high land already mentioned. This cape is placed by the Dutch maps in
7 degrees 52 minutes south. But according to my observation and our
estimated distance from the land I make it in 7 degrees 46 minutes south
latitude. The longitude by my dead reckoning from Coupang to Cape Sandana
was 11 degrees 33 minutes west.

Thursday 10.

We steered to the westward along the coast of Java and on the 10th at
noon we anchored off Passourwang, a Dutch settlement on the coast of
Java, in two fathoms, distant from the shore half a league, the entrance
of the river bearing south-west. The coast hereabouts so is shoal that
large ships are obliged to anchor three or four miles from the land. As
soon as we were at anchor I got in my boat and went on shore. The banks
of the river near the entrance were mud, on which grew a few mangrove
bushes. Among them we saw hogs running and many were laying dead in the
mud, which caused a most intolerable stench and made me heartily repent
having come here; but after proceeding about a mile up the river, the
course of which was serpentine, we found a very pleasant country and
landed at a small and well-constructed fort, where I was received in a
friendly and polite manner by M. Adrian van Rye, the commandant. By the
return of the boat I sent on board a small bullock and other provisions.
I likewise took a pilot to conduct us to Sourabaya.

The houses at Passourwang are neatly built and the country appears to be
well cultivated. The produce of this settlement is rice, of which they
export large quantities. There are but few Dutch here: the Javanese are
numerous and their chief lives with considerable splendour. They have
good roads and posts are established along the coast; and it appears to
be a busy and well-regulated settlement. Latitude 7 degrees 36 minutes
south. Longitude 1 degree 44 minutes west of Cape Sandana.

Friday 11.

The next day about noon we sailed.

Saturday 12.

And on the 12th in the evening anchored in Sourabaya road in seven
fathoms: the flagstaff bearing south one quarter west; distance from the
shore one mile. We found riding here seven square-rigged and several
smaller vessels.

It was too late when we anchored to send a boat on shore.

Sunday 13.

The next morning before daylight three guard-boats stationed themselves
near us and I was informed that I must not land or send a boat on shore.
This restriction I learnt from the officer of the guard-boats was in
conformity to general orders concerning all strange vessels on their
first arrival. At nine in the forenoon leave came off for us to land and
soon after the guard-boats quitted us.

I was received on shore with great civility and friendship by the
governor or Opperhoost M. Ant. Barkay, and the commandant of the troops
M. de Bose. By these gentlemen I was hospitably entertained, and advised
to remain till the 16th when some vessels were to sail, with whom I might
keep company, which they recommended on account of pirates.

Sourabaya is one of the most pleasant places I ever saw. It is situated
on the banks of a river and is a mile and a half distant from the
seashore so that only the flagstaff can be seen from the road. The river
is navigable up to the town for vessels of 100 tons burden, and the bank
on one side is made convenient for tracking. The Chinese carry on a
considerable trade here, and have a town or camp on the side of the river
opposite to Sourabaya. The country near the town is flat and the soil
light, so that they plow with a single bullock or buffalo (karrabow). The
interior parts of the country near the mountains are infested with a
breed of fierce tigers, which makes travelling inland very dangerous.
They have here a breed of horses which are small but they are handsome
and strong.

The Javanese in this neighbourhood are numerous. M. Barkay and M. de Bose
took me with them to pay a visit to two of the principal natives, whom we
found attended by a number of men armed with pikes in great military
order. We were entertained with a concert of music; the instruments were
gongs, drums, and a fiddle with two strings. I hired a pilot here to
carry us to Batavia. Our latitude observed in Sourabaya road was 7
degrees 11 minutes south. Longitude made from Cape Sandana 1 degree 52
minutes west.

Thursday 17.

On the 17th we sailed from Sourabaya in company with three prows. At noon
we anchored at Crissey which is a town with a small fort belonging to the
Dutch. We remained here about two hours and then weighed. Latitude of
Crissey 7 degrees 9 minutes south. Longitude from Cape Sandana 1 degree
55 minutes west.

The navigation through the Straits of Madura is so intricate that with
the little opportunity I had I am unable to undertake a description of
it.

Friday 18.

The next day, having passed the straits, we bore away to the westward
along the coast of Java in company with the prows before mentioned.

Tuesday 22.

We had regular soundings all the way to Samarang, off which place we
anchored on the 22nd in the afternoon; the church bearing south-east;
distance from the shore half a league: depth of water two fathoms. The
shoalness of the coast here makes the road of Samarang very inconvenient,
both on account of the great distance that large ships (of which there
were several in the road) are obliged to lay from the shore, and of the
landing which is in a river that cannot be entered before half-flood.
This river resembles the one at Passourwang, the shores being low with
offensive dead animals laying about. I was met at the landing-place by
the equipage-master, and he furnished me with a carriage to carry me to
the governor, whose residence is about two miles from the town of
Samarang. I requested and obtained leave to have our wants supplied,
which were to recruit our provisions, and to get a any mainmast, having
sprung ours in the passage from Sourabaya.

Samarang is a fortified town surrounded by a wall and ditch, and is the
most considerable settlement next to Batavia that the Dutch have in Java.
Here is a very good hospital and a public school, chiefly for teaching
the mathematics. They have likewise a theatre. Provisions are remarkably
cheap here, beef being at ten doits per pound and the price of a fowl 12
doits.

I experienced great civility from some of the gentlemen at Samarang,
particularly from M. le Baron de Bose, a merchant, brother to the M. de
Bose, commandant of the troops at Sourabaya: and from M. Abegg, the
surgeon of the hospital, to whom we were indebted for advice and
medicines for which he would not consent to receive payment.

The latitude of Samarang is 6 degrees 57 minutes. Longitude by my
reckoning from Cape Sandana 4 degrees 7 minutes west.

Saturday 26.

On the 26th we sailed from Samarang and with us a galley mounting six
swivels which the governor had directed to accompany us to Batavia.

October. Thursday 1.

On the 1st of October we anchored in Batavia road, where we found riding
a Dutch ship of war and 20 sail of Dutch East India ships, besides many
smaller vessels.


CHAPTER 20.

Occurrences at Batavia and Passage thence to England.

OCTOBER 1789.

In the afternoon at four o'clock I went on shore and landed at a house by
the river where strangers first stop and give an account who they are,
whence they came, etc. From this place a Malay gentleman took me in a
carriage to Sabandar, Mr. Engelhard, whose house was in the environs of
the city on the side nearest the shipping. The Sabandar is the officer
with whom all strangers are obliged to transact their business: at least
the whole must go through his hands. With him I went to pay my respects
to the governor-general who received me with great civility. I acquainted
his excellency with my situation and requested my people might be taken
care of and that we should be allowed to take a passage to Europe in the
first ship that sailed. I likewise desired permission to sell the
schooner and launch. All this his excellency told me should be granted. I
then took leave and returned with the Sabandar who wrote down the
particulars of my wants in order to form from them a regular petition to
be presented to the council the next day. I had brought from the governor
of Coupang, directed for the governor-general at Batavia, the account of
my voyage and misfortune, translated into Dutch from an account that I
had given to Mr. van Este. So attentive had they been at Timor to
everything that related to us.

There is a large hotel at Batavia fitted up purposely for the
accommodation of strangers, who are not allowed to reside at any other
place. It is situated near the great river in a part of the city that is
reckoned the most airy and healthy. Nevertheless I found the air hot and
suffocating and was taken ill in the night with a violent pain in my
head.

Friday 2.

The next morning at nine the council sat and I attended, accompanied by
the Sabandar; and was informed that the council had complied with all I
had requested.

When I returned to the hotel my headache increased and a violent fever
came on. I sent to acquaint the Sabandar of my situation and was soon
after attended by the head surgeon of the town hospital Mr. Aansorp, by
whose care and skill in less than 24 hours the fever considerably abated
but a severe headache continued. I had an invitation from the
governor-general to dine with him, which of course I was obliged to
decline.

I hired a carriage which cost three dollars per day for the benefit of
taking an airing. My lodgings at the hotel were so close and hot that I
desired the Sabandar to apply to the Governor-General for leave to hire a
house in the country; which request his excellency not only immediately
complied with but gave directions for my being accommodated at the house
of the physician or surgeon-general Mr. Sparling.

One of my people, Thomas Hall, being ill with a flux I obtained leave for
him to be sent to the country hospital which is a convenient airy
building.

Tuesday 6.

This morning at sunrise I left the hotel and was carried to Mr.
Sparling's house, about four miles distant from the city and near the
convalescent hospital which at this time had also sick men in it, the
whole number of patients amounting to 800. I found everything prepared
for my comfort and convenience. Mr. Sparling would suffer me to take no
medicine though I had still considerable fever with headache: but I found
so much relief from the difference of the air that in the evening I was
able to accompany Mr. Sparling on a visit to the governor-general at one
of his country seats, where we found many ladies all dressed in the Malay
fashion, some of them richly ornamented with jewels. I had invitations
from several gentlemen and some very kindly pressed me to make their
country houses my abode till my health should be reestablished.

My indisposition increasing, Mr. Sparling advised me to quit Batavia as
speedily as possible and represented the necessity of it to the
governor-general. I was informed from his excellency that the
homeward-bound ships were so much crowded that there would be no
possibility of all my people going in one ship, and that they could be
accommodated no other way than by dividing them into different ships.
Seeing therefore that a separation was unavoidable I determined to follow
the advice of the physician and, as a packet was appointed to sail for
Europe on the 16th instant, I sent to request of the governor that I
might be allowed to take a passage in her for myself and as many of my
people as they were able to receive. In answer to this I was acquainted
that myself and two more could be accommodated in the packet, she being
too small to admit a greater number; but that I might rest assured of
passages being provided for those that remained by the earliest
opportunities.

Friday 9.

This day anchored in the road the General Elliot, an English ship
commanded by Captain Lloyd. In the Straits of Banca he had met with some
boats belonging to the East India Company's ship Vansittart that was lost
in the straits of Billaton by having struck on a rock that went through
her bottom. Captain Wilson, who commanded the Vansittart, I was informed
had just finished a survey of those Straits and was hoisting his boat in
when the ship struck. Immediately on receiving the intelligence Captain
Lloyd, in the General Elliot and another ship in company called the
Nonsuch, sailed for the wreck. They found the ship had been burnt down to
the water's edge by the Malays. They however saved 40 chests of treasure
out of 55 which were said to have been on board. Most of the ship's
company were saved: one man only was lost in the ship, and five others in
a small boat were missing who were supposed to have taken some of the
treasure. The greater part of the people went with Captain Wilson to
China, and some were with Captain Lloyd.

Saturday 10.

This morning the Resource was sold by public auction: the custom at
Batavia is to begin high and to lower the price till some person bids;
and the first bidder is the buyer. She was accordingly put up at 2000
rix-dollars but to my great disappointment no one offered to purchase
before the auctioneer had lowered the demand to 295 rix-dollars, for
which price she was sold, the purchaser being an Englishman, Captain John
Eddie, who commanded an English ship from Bengal. If no strangers had
been present at the sale I imagine they would have let her run down to
200 dollars, in which case I should have had no alternative.

The launch likewise was sold. The services she had rendered us made me
feel great reluctance at parting with her; which I would not have done if
I could have found a convenient opportunity of getting her conveyed to
Europe.

Little as the schooner had sold for I found I was in danger of having the
sum lessened; for the Sabandar informed me that by an order of the
council there was a duty on the sale of all vessels. With this demand I
would by no means comply for I thought I had sufficiently suffered in
sustaining a loss of 705 rix-dollars out of 1000 by the purchase and sale
of the vessel, she having cost 1000 rix-dollars.

This day Thomas Hall, whom I had sent to be taken care of at the
hospital, died. He had been ill of a flux from the time of our arrival at
Timor.

Monday 12.

I agreed with the captain of the packet for a passage to Europe for
myself, my clerk, and a servant. The Sabandar informed me it was
necessary that my officers and people should be examined before a notary
respecting the loss of the Bounty, as otherwise the governor and council
were not legally authorised to detain her if she should be found in any
of the Dutch settlements. They were therefore at my desire examined, and
afterwards made affidavit before the governor and council at the
Stadthouse.

My officers complaining to me of the unreasonableness of some tradesmen's
bills I spoke to the Sabandar. A bill of 51 dollars for five hats he
reduced to 30 dollars and in other articles made proportionable
deductions.

Paper money is the currency of Batavia and is so understood in all
bargains. At this time paper was at 28 per cent discount: there is
likewise a difference in the value of the ducatoon which at Batavia is 80
stivers and in Holland only 63 stivers: this occasions a loss of 21 1/4
per cent on remittance of money. It therefore follows that if any person
at Batavia remits money by bills of exchange to Europe they lose by the
discount and the exchange 49 1/4 per cent.

Those who have accounts to pay and can give unexceptionable bills on
Europe will find a considerable saving by negotiating their bills with
private people who are glad to give for them a premium of 20 per cent at
the least. This discovery I made somewhat too late to profit by.

One of the greatest difficulties that strangers have to encounter is
their being obliged to live at the hotel. This hotel was formerly two
houses which by doors of communication have been made one. It is in the
middle of a range of buildings more calculated for a cold country than
for such a climate as Batavia. There is no free circulation of air and
what is equally bad it is always very dirty; and there is great want of
attendance. What they call cleaning the house is another nuisance; for
they never use any water to cool it or to lay the dust, but sweep daily
with brooms in such a manner that those in the house are almost
suffocated by a cloud of dust.

The months of December and January are reckoned the most unhealthy of the
year, the heavy rains being then set in. The account of the seasons as
given to me here I believe may be relied on.

The middle of November the west monsoon begins and rain.

December and January. Continual rain with strong westerly wind.

February. Westerly wind. Towards the end of this month the rain begins to
abate.

March. Intervals of fine weather. Wind westerly.

April. In this month the east monsoon begins. Weather generally fine with
showers of rain.

May. East monsoon fixed. Showery.

June and July. Clear weather. Strong east wind.

August and September. Wind more moderate.

October. In this month the wind begins to be variable with showers of
rain.

The current is said always to run with the wind. Nevertheless I found the
reverse in sailing from Timor to Java. Between the end of October and the
beginning of the ensuing year no Dutch ship bound for Europe is allowed
to sail from Batavia for fear of being near the Mauritius at the time of
the hurricanes which are frequent there in December and January.

My illness prevented me from gaining much knowledge of Batavia. Of their
public buildings I saw nothing that gave me so much satisfaction as their
country hospital for seamen. It is a large commodious and airy building
about four miles from the town, close to the side of the river, or rather
in the river: for the ground on which it stands has by labour been made
an island of, and the sick are carried there in a boat: each ward is a
separate dwelling and the different diseases are properly classed. They
have sometimes 1400 patients in it: at this time there were 800, but more
than half of these were recovered and fit for service, of whom 300 were
destined for the fleet that was to sail for Europe. I went through most
of the wards and there appeared great care and attention. The sheets,
bedding, and linen of the sick were perfectly neat and clean. The house
of the physician, Mr. Sparling, who has the management of the hospital is
at one extremity of the building: and here it was that I resided. To the
attention and care of this gentleman, for which he would receive no
payment, I am probably indebted for my life.

The hospital in the town is well attended, but the situation is so ill
chosen that it certainly would be the saving of many lives to build one
in its stead up the river, which might be done with great advantage as
water carriage is so easy and convenient. A great neglect in some of the
commanders of the shipping here was suffering their people to go dirty
and frequently without frock, shirt, or anything to cover their bodies,
which, besides being a public nuisance, must probably be productive of
ill health in the most robust constitution.

The governor-general gave me leave to lodge all my people at the country
hospital which I thought a great advantage and with which they were
perfectly satisfied. The officers however at their own request remained
in the town.

The time fixed for the sailing of the packet approaching, I settled my
accounts with the Sabandar, leaving open the victualling account to be
closed by Mr. Fryer the master previous to his departure, who I likewise
authorised to supply the men and officers left under his command with one
month's pay to enable them to purchase clothing for their passage to
England.

I had been at great pains to bring living plants from Timor, in six tubs,
which contained jacks, nancas, karambolas, namnams, jambos, and three
thriving breadfruit plants. These I thought might be serviceable at the
Cape of Good Hope if brought no farther: but I had the mortification of
being obliged to leave them all at Batavia. I took these plants on board
at Coupang on the 20th of August: they had experienced a passage of 42
days to my arrival here. The breadfruit plants died to the root and
sprouted afresh from thence. The karambolas, jacks, nancas, and namnams I
had raised from the seed and they were in fine order. No judgment can
hence be formed of the success of transporting plants, as in the present
trial they had many disadvantages.

Friday 16.

This morning being sunrise I embarked on board the Vlydte packet
commanded by Captain Peter Couvret, bound for Middleburgh. With me
likewise embarked Mr. John Samwell, clerk, and John Smith, seaman. Those
of our company who stayed behind the governor promised me should follow
in the first ships and be as little divided as possible. At 7 o'clock the
packet weighed and sailed out of the road.

Sunday 18.

On the 18th we spoke the Rambler, an American brig belonging to Boston,
bound to Batavia. After passing the Straits of Sunda we steered to the
north of the Cocos Isles. These islands, Captain Couvret informed me, are
full of coconut trees: there is no anchorage near them but good landing
for boats. Their latitude 12 degrees 0 minutes south. Longitude 96
degrees 5 minutes east.

In the passage to the Cape of Good Hope there occurred nothing worth
remark. I cannot however forbear noticing the Dutch manner of navigating.
They steer by true compass, or rather endeavour so to do, by means of a
small movable central card, which they set to the meridian: and whenever
they discover the variation has altered 2 1/2 degrees since the last
adjustment they again correct the central card. This is steering within a
quarter of a point, without aiming at greater exactness. The officer of
the watch likewise corrects the course for leeway by his own judgment
before it is marked down in the log board. They heave no log: I was told
that the company do not allow it. Their manner of computing their run is
by means of a measured distance of 40 feet along the ship's side: they
take notice of any remarkable patch of froth when it is abreast the
foremost end of the measured distance, and count half seconds till the
mark of froth is abreast the after end. With the number of half seconds
thus obtained they divide the number 48, taking the product for the rate
of sailing in geographical miles in one hour, or the number of Dutch
miles in four hours.

It is not usual to make any allowance to the sun's declination on account
of being on a different meridian from that for which the tables are
calculated: they in general compute with the numbers just as they are
found in the table. From all this it is not difficult to conceive the
reason why the Dutch are frequently above ten degrees out in their
reckoning. Their passages likewise are considerably lengthened by not
carrying a sufficient quantity of sail.

December 16.

In the afternoon we anchored in Table Bay.

December 17.

The next morning I went on shore and waited on his excellency M. Vander
Graaf who received me in the most polite and friendly manner. The
Guardian, commanded by Lieutenant Riou, had left the Cape about eight
days before with cattle and stores for Port Jackson. This day anchored in
table bay the Astree, a French frigate, commanded by the Count de St.
Rivel from the Isle of France, on board of which ship was the late
governor, the Chevalier d'Entrecasteaux. Other ships that arrived during
my stay at the Cape were a French 40-gun frigate, an East India ship, and
a brig, of the same nation: likewise two other French ships with slaves
from the coast of Mozambique bound to the West Indies: a Dutch packet
from Europe, after a four months passage: and the Harpy, a South Sea
Whaler with 500 barrels of spermaceti, and 400 of seal and other oils.
There is a standing order from the Dutch East India Company that no
person who takes a passage from Batavia for Europe in any of their ships
shall be allowed to leave the ship before she arrives at her intended
port. According to which regulation I must have gone to Holland in the
packet. Of this I was not informed till I was taking leave of the
governor-general at Batavia, when it was too late for him to give the
Captain an order to permit me to land in the channel. He however desired
I would make use of his name to governor Vander Graaf, who readily
complied with my request and gave the necessary orders to the Captain of
the packet, a copy of which his excellency gave to me; and at the same
time recommendatory letters to people of consequence in Holland in case I
should be obliged to proceed so far.

I left a letter at the Cape of Good Hope to be forwarded to governor
Phillips at Port Jackson by the first opportunity, containing a short
account of my voyage with a descriptive list of the pirates: and from
Batavia I had written to Lord Cornwallis, so that every part of India
will be prepared to receive them.

Saturday 2.

We sailed from the Cape in company with the Astree French frigate. The
next morning neither ship nor land were in sight. On the 15th we passed
in sight of the island St. Helena. The 21st we saw the island Ascension.
On the 10th of February, the wind being at north-east blowing fresh, our
sails were covered with a fine orange-coloured dust. Fuego, the
westernmost of the Cape de Verde islands and the nearest land to us on
that day at noon bore north-east by east half east, distance 140 leagues.
When we had passed the latitude of the Western Islands a lookout was kept
for some rocks which Captain Couvret had been informed lay in latitude 44
degrees 25 minutes north and 2 degrees 50 minutes east longitude from the
east end of St. Michael. This information Captain Couvret had received
from a person that he knew and who said he had seen them. On the 13th of
March we saw the Bill of Portland and on the evening of the next day,
Sunday March the 14th, I left the packet and was landed at Portsmouth by
an Isle of Wight boat.

Those of my officers and people whom I left at Batavia were provided with
passages in the earliest ships; and at the time we parted were apparently
in good health. Nevertheless they did not all live to quit Batavia. Mr.
Elphinstone, master's mate, and Peter Linkletter, seaman, died within a
fortnight after my departure, the hardships they had experienced having
rendered them unequal to cope with so unhealthy a climate as that of
Batavia. The remainder embarked on board the Dutch fleet for Europe, and
arrived safe at this country, except Robert Lamb, who died on the
passage, and Mr. Ledward the surgeon who has not yet been heard of. Thus
of nineteen who were forced by the mutineers into the launch it has
pleased God that twelve should surmount the difficulties and dangers of
the voyage and live to revisit their native country.
