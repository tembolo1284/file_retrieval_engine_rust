** A note on CD and DVD disc capacity.  It turns out that disk drive
manufacturers (including the people who make CD and DVD burners and
blank discs) measure disk space differently than the rest of the
computer world.  To them, 1MB, which is 1 megabyte, is 1,000,000
bytes.  For the rest of the computer world, 1MB is 1,046,576 bytes.
We mention this because people might read their DVD disc package and
expect it to hold 4.7GB, but be surprised to find it can only hold
about 4.37GB as the rest of the world measures space.
